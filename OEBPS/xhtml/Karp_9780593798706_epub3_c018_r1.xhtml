			<p class="para-pf dropcaps2line char-dropcap-DC" style="text-indent:0;">I<span class="char-first"><span class="fv-allsmallcaps">n 1969, the television series </span></span><i class="char-i">Civilisation</i>, a monumental and ambitious account of art history from ancient Rome to medieval France and beyond, aired in the United Kingdom, captivating households across the country. <span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText534"/>More than two million people watched the program. <span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText535"/>Church services were rescheduled in some parishes to ensure that the show could be seen. The program’s presenter, Kenneth Clark, born in 1903 in London, was the product of another age, unapologetically aristocratic; he offered what appeared to be a coherent narrative of the march toward beauty and greatness of Western art. In postwar Britain, as well as the United States, his worldview was comforting to many and intentionally anachronistic. Clark’s judgments about the merits of an artist’s work or an epoch’s aesthetic bounty had the force of legal edicts. <span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText536"/>The painting of sixteenth-century Rome struck him as “feeble, mannered,” and “self-conscious.”</p>
			<p class="para-p">For Clark, there was high and low, and civilization was, or at least should be, on a march toward something greater. <span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText537"/>He compared an African mask, leaving its country of origin on the continent unspecified, with the Apollo Belvedere at the Vatican, concluding with characteristic assuredness that “the Apollo embodies a higher state of civilisation than the mask.” <span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText538"/>Elsewhere he declined, with a bracing dismissiveness, to provide Spain a central role in the history of <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_206" role="doc-pagebreak" title="206"/>Western civilization, questioning what of significance the country had done “to enlarge the human mind and pull mankind a few steps up the hill.” Clark represented, and his work continues to stake out, a certain ideological pole: the view that sweeping aesthetic, and nearly moral, judgments could be made about entire cultures. Their sense of taste, capacity for innovation, and ultimately contribution to human progress were all fair game for assessment and review.</p>
			<p class="para-p">The public consumed his narrative but ultimately revolted. Clark, and his series, have been the subject of sustained attacks in the decades since the program’s release. <span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText539"/>Mary Beard, a British author and historian, recalled in 2016, decades after first encountering the series, that she had begun “to feel decidedly uncomfortable with Clark’s patrician self-confidence and the ‘great man’ approach to art history—one damn genius after the next.” So much of what Clark said could never be said today. But in our rush to rebel against the oppression of a narrow account of Western art and history, we perhaps deprived ourselves of more than we anticipated. The sweeping away of anachronisms such as Clark coincided with the abandonment of other normative and aesthetic frameworks. And we have, as a result, unwittingly diminished our capacity to discern and indeed judge.</p>
			<p class="para-p"><span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText540"/>Even modest attempts to invoke beauty today—such as a swipe at a recent theatrical production by the columnist Peggy Noonan as “ugly, bizarre, inartistic”—are now fraught and resisted. The reshaping of art criticism, the challenges to Clark’s mode of being, were the canary in the coal mine. Art might have been first, but much more was to follow. Taste and broader expressions of aesthetic preference—indeed, the suggestion of any preference at all in some contexts—have been shunned as divisive, and mere expressions of elite sensibility. <span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText541"/>As David Denby wrote in an essay in the <i class="char-i">New Yorker</i> in 1997, “aesthetic taste” is now at risk of being dismissed as a mere product of “status-seeking behavior.” It is true, of course, that purportedly neutral or innocent aesthetic decisions are often means of constructing and maintaining caste hierarchies. <span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText542"/>Thorstein Veblen, an <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_207" role="doc-pagebreak" title="207"/>American sociologist, observed in 1899 that the “circuitous” driveways on the secluded country estates of the British elite, with their gratuitous curves, were a means of expressing power. But is there nothing in our aesthetic lives, no sense of north or south, that ought to be retained?</p>
			<p class="para-p">Our collective and contemporary fear of making claims about truth, beauty, the good life, and indeed justice have led us to the embrace of a thin version of collective identity, one that is incapable of providing meaningful direction to the human experience. All cultures are now equal. Criticism and value judgments are forbidden. Yet this new dogma glosses over the fact that certain cultures and indeed subcultures, including the norms and organizational habits of Silicon Valley, notwithstanding its flaws and contradictions, have produced wonders. Others have proven middling, and worse, regressive and harmful. We are perhaps right to recoil at the summary abandonment of the unnamed “African mask” in favor of the white marble of the Apollo. But should we be left with no means of discerning between art that moves us forward, ideas that advance humanity’s cause, and those that do not? The risk is that our fear to pronounce, to speak, to prefer, has left us without direction and confidence when it comes to marshaling our shared resources and talents. Fear has led us to recoil and shrink our sense of the possible, and this fear has found its way into every aspect of our lives.</p>
			<p class="para-p">This abandonment of an aesthetic point of view is lethal to building technology. The construction of software requires taste, both in crafting the programs involved and in selecting the personalities required to build them. It is as much an art as it is a science. Silicon Valley has risen from a small patch of land in Santa Clara County, and built so much and so quickly, in part because it preserved space for the Clarks of the world. Founders have an aesthetic point of view. Their métier might not be nineteenth-century sculpture or Italian frescoes, but they found a space in the Valley that permitted them to exercise what is essentially an artistic form of judgment, and to <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_208" role="doc-pagebreak" title="208"/>create in a world where normative claims about good and bad, and narrative arcs of triumph and defeat, were still permitted to exist. The outperformers of the current moment, those who founded and built the world’s largest technology companies, which in their size and influence now rival small countries, have largely walled themselves off from society in order to build. Their craft required insulation from the world, not immersion in it, as well as personal judgment and preference.</p>

			<p class="para-p">The commitment to a single path or point of view, and the limiting of one’s options, can sometimes be the most effective, indeed the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_209" role="doc-pagebreak" title="209"/>only, means of navigating the vicissitudes and pressures of public life. <span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText544"/>When Odysseus asked his crew to tie him to the mast of his ship as it sailed past the Sirens and their bewitching call, he warned his men, “If I should entreat you, and bid you set me free,” then “with still more fetters bind me fast.” He was intentionally restraining his own range of motion, his ability to respond to the outside world and to the risk of being diverted by its enchanting, and indeed deadly, temptation. A freedom of motion, to maneuver at will, can masquerade as an imitation of power. A willingness to constrain choice, to cast oneself to the mast, is often the best, if not only, route to creative production, for either a company or a culture.</p>

			<p class="para-paft"><span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText545"/>The outperformance of founder-led companies, for which there is a growing body of evidence, is the result of this privileging of an aesthetic point of view, of space to pronounce and decide. Such economic outperformance has been deeply counterintuitive, even confounding, to many. Companies ruled by committee, with increased oversight and control over management, should, according to the catechism of the free market, be more efficient and effective over time. The evidence, however, suggests otherwise.</p>
			<p class="para-p">Rüdiger Fahlenbrach, a finance professor at École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne in Switzerland, compiled a list of 2,327 U.S. companies over a ten-year period from 1992 to 2002, of which 361 were run by a founder as opposed to a professional or appointed CEO. <span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText546"/>He found that an investment approach that purchased shares solely in companies run by founders would have earned an excess annual return of 10.7 percent, or 4.4 percent more per year than a portfolio that included all companies, founder-run and otherwise, even when controlling for various other factors including industry and the age of the business. Similar results had been observed with family-owned firms, but Fahlenbrach’s research <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_210" role="doc-pagebreak" title="210"/>helped distinguish the drivers behind the faster than average growth rates of companies that were controlled by a single family from those that were run by that family as well. <span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText547"/>He concluded that “a large ownership stake by descendants of a founding family” alone was insufficient to affect a company’s value on the market; it was rather firms that maintained a founder at the helm that reliably outperformed over time.</p>

			</figure>
			<p class="para-p">Others have observed similar results. A group of researchers at Purdue University surveyed the five hundred companies in the S&amp;P 500, an index of the largest and most significant businesses in America, over a ten-year period from 1993 to 2003 to determine whether founder-led companies produced more innovation, as measured by patents that were cited widely by others. The researchers were interested not in the mere filing of a patent application but rather in patents that, over time, came to be referenced repeatedly in <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_211" role="doc-pagebreak" title="211"/>academic journals and other publications. <span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText548"/>The team at Purdue found that companies led by founders as opposed to professional CEOs held a 31 percent higher number of significant patents.</p>
			<p class="para-p">Such outperformance is anything but an accident. The union of the pursuit of innovation with the rigor of engineering execution requires a degree of insulation from the outside world, some protection from the instincts and often misdirections of the market. Nothing much of substance, and certainly nothing lasting, will be created by committee. Our challenge, both in the United States and in the West more broadly, will be to harness and channel the creative energies of this new founding generation, these technical iconoclasts, into serving something more than their individual interests.</p>
			<p class="para-p">An ownership culture must be allowed and encouraged to take root in our society. David Swensen, the former investment chief of Yale’s endowment, was at the helm of the organization for thirty-five years. He spoke of investing the resources of the university, which was founded in 1701, in order to ensure not years or even decades of strong performance but another three centuries of the school’s existence. <span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText549"/>For Swensen, “short-termism” and the market’s “focus on quarter-to-quarter earnings” are “incredibly damaging,” as he said in an interview in 2017. It is rather a sort of stewardship, of the temporary and conditional ownership of an asset, that allows one to preserve its value over the long term.</p>
			<p class="para-p">One of the central advantages of Silicon Valley was its embrace—imperfect, halting, and full of contradictions—of an ownership society, a regime in which the labor, the creative talent within organizations, had a substantial stake in the success and outcomes of the businesses they were building. It is easy to forget that the act of granting equity to all employees at a technology company, from administrative assistants to executives, was a radical one in the 1990s, departing from the prevailing model of hourly rates and salaries for an organization’s staff while owners reaped outsize rewards. A handful of other industries had flirted with shared ownership models, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_212" role="doc-pagebreak" title="212"/>from law firms to medical practices, but the significant equity stakes were in practice often limited to a thin swath of managers at the helm of an organization.</p>
			<p class="para-p">Silicon Valley went much further, and the strategy proved essential to its success. Many of the world’s most prominent technology companies were essentially communally owned. <span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText550"/>The early participants shared in the risk and the reward. Silicon Valley remains one of the few places in the world where individuals of low birth, to use a phrase of the constitutional law scholar Akhil Reed Amar, can own something substantial and participate in the upside of their labor, rather than remain cogs, even if often highly paid cogs, in the ventures of another. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, a talented graduate could perhaps join Goldman Sachs, which was a pioneer of partnership compensation models, or perhaps a white-shoe law firm, where attorneys shared the profits, and risk, of their work. But those experiments have essentially withered; such firms still attract talented and ambitious minds, but they are paid salaries, often high ones, but salaries nonetheless. The upside of the endeavors and creative energy of labor is captured by the capitalists.</p>

			<p class="para-paft">In 1934, Ruth Benedict published <i class="char-i">Patterns of Culture</i>, in which she recounted her experience living with and studying preindustrial communities in western Canada, Melanesia, and the Southwest of the United States. <span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText551"/>She described working toward “a more realistic social faith,” one that accounted for the variation across human cultures and cultural practices. But she went further as well, describing “the co-existing and equally valid patterns of life which mankind has created for itself from the raw materials of existence.” It was her reference to “equally valid” cultures that would prompt a century of discussion and debate. <span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText552"/>For several generations of anthropologists, the study of preindustrial societies became a means of elevating <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_213" role="doc-pagebreak" title="213"/>them, but also by extension unwittingly exempting them from the realm of moral scrutiny.<a class="char-fnref footnote_ref" epub:type="noteref" href="Karp_9780593798706_epub3_c018_r1.xhtml#_footnote_d1-00015ef7" id="_footnote_referrer_d1-00015ef7" role="doc-noteref" title="footnote">[*2]</a></p>
			<p class="para-p">Silicon Valley, in its modern form, was a product of this intellectual tradition, of a cultural and moral agnosticism if not relativism that assiduously avoided anything approaching substantive views about the good life. <span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText554"/>The effective altruism movement, which took hold in the Valley over the past decade and was advanced by the philosopher Peter Singer, among others, sought to build on the intuitive appeal of ethical universalism—the view that all humans, and indeed some nonhumans, should be considered in our moral calculus. The work of Singer, who was born in Melbourne, Australia, and taught at Princeton for more than two decades, was attractive because it seemed to have solved the puzzle: well-being, whether of humans or sea otters, was all that mattered. <span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText555"/>But this approach provided cover for a generation to avoid more thorny questions about what constitutes a life well lived, the boundaries and content of national identity, and the human search for meaning. Roger Scruton, a British philosopher, critiqued Singer for adopting “a vacuous utilitarianism” whose elegance and simplicity, alluring as they were, nonetheless reduced experience to a single metric. The founders of many of the leading firms in Silicon Valley were not <i class="char-i">immoral</i>, in this sense; they were simply <i class="char-i">amoral</i>, skeptical of grand belief structures and worldviews and affirmative conceptions of what a collective life could or ought to be.</p>
			<p class="para-p">The entrepreneurs of Silicon Valley do not lack idealism; indeed, they often appear to be brimming with it. But it is thin and can <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_214" role="doc-pagebreak" title="214"/>wither under even the slightest scrutiny. The legions of young founders have for decades now routinely claimed that they aspire to change the world. Yet such claims have grown meaningless from overuse. This cloak of idealism was put on in order to relieve these young founders of the need to develop anything approaching a more substantial worldview. And the nation-state itself, the most effective means of collective organization in pursuit of a shared purpose that the world has ever known, was cast aside as an obstacle to progress.</p>

			<div aria-hidden="true" class="para-orn">• • •</div>
			<p class="para-paft"><span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText556"/>Leo Strauss, who was born in Prussia in the late nineteenth century and taught at the University of Chicago, argued that the rejection of the moral point of view was in many ways a precondition of the Enlightenment and indeed the scientific revolution that made Silicon Valley possible, writing that “moral obtuseness,” a relinquishing or at least pause in the search for a definition of good and evil, “is the necessary condition for scientific analysis.” <span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText557"/>He was also early to observe that such a clean bifurcation of endeavors, between the scientific and the moral, was in practice far more difficult—that “the value judgments which are forbidden to enter through the front door of political science, sociology or economics, enter these disciplines through the back door.” For Strauss, the contemporary social scientist had rejected values in favor of a search for truth and convinced himself that such a distinction was possible. <span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText558"/>But it was this “indifference to any goal, or of aimlessness and drifting,” as Strauss put it, that is the seed of our current nihilism as a culture.</p>
			<p class="para-p">The legions of Silicon Valley entrepreneurs and engineers were the successors to a previous generation of academics who had attempted to hide behind the purportedly neutral pursuit of scientific discovery. The enforced neutrality, first in colleges and universities and later within the technology companies that have constructed the world within which we all now operate, has left us with a hollow <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_215" role="doc-pagebreak" title="215"/>republic, something far short of that which we are capable of building. But constructing a technological republic, a rich and thriving and raucously creative communal experiment—not merely the bacchanal of permissive egalitarianism of which Strauss warned—will require an embrace of value, virtue, and culture, the very things that the present generation was taught to abhor.</p>
			<p class="para-p"><span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText559"/>For Lee Kuan Yew, the aspirational ideal was to become, as Confucius urged more than two thousand years ago, a <i class="char-i">junzi</i>, which has been variously translated as an “exemplary person,” or “gentleman.” <span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText560"/>This was someone who is “loyal to his father and mother,” “faithful to his wife,” “brings up his children well,” and is a “loyal citizen of his emperor,” Lee said in an interview. Such a specific conception of virtue, for many today, must be resisted as parochial and exclusionary. But what virtues, what conception of the noble or indeed exemplary life, are we willing to advance and defend in the place of the ones that have been jettisoned in the name of inclusivity?</p>
			<p class="para-p">The fall of empires has been accompanied before by an abandonment of the pursuit and nurturing of virtue. Sallust, the Roman historian born in 86 B.C., chronicled the descent of the republic around him, as Catiline attempted a coup and was later killed by the Roman army. <span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText561"/>Sallust wrote that “as a result of riches, the youth were suddenly consumed with luxury and greed, together with insolence.” And they grew disinterested in anything beyond their own enrichment. A bland and unsatisfying utilitarianism will not suffice to remedy the current malaise. The effective altruists were shrewd in co-opting the language of moral philosophy, but their move merely delayed a reckoning with man’s search for meaning. <span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText562"/>As Irving Kristol, who founded the <i class="char-i">National Interest</i> in 1985, has written, “The delicate task that faces our civilization today is not to reform the secular, rationalist orthodoxy,” but rather “to breathe new life into the older, now largely comatose, religious orthodoxies.”</p>
			<p class="para-p">And it is here that the establishment left has failed its cause and so thoroughly eroded its potential. The frenetic pursuit of a shallow <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_216" role="doc-pagebreak" title="216"/>egalitarianism in the end hollowed out its broader and more compelling political project. The right was pursued while the good was abandoned. What we need is more cultural specificity—in education, technology, and politics—not less. The vacant neutrality of the current moment risks allowing our instinct for discernment to atrophy.<a class="char-fnref footnote_ref" epub:type="noteref" href="Karp_9780593798706_epub3_c018_r1.xhtml#_footnote_d1-00015efb" id="_footnote_referrer_d1-00015efb" role="doc-noteref" title="footnote">[*3]</a> We must now take seriously the possibility that it will be the resurrection of a shared culture, not its abandonment, that will make possible our continued survival and cohesion.</p>
			<p class="para-p">It was a distaste for collective experience and endeavor that made America, and American culture, vulnerable to attack and infiltration. We had been trained to be so careful, so reluctant to speak about the content of American culture, if there was any, that the act of cultural production and manufacture migrated to other, less hostile domains. At present, the principal features of American society that are shared are not civic or political, but rather cohere around entertainment, sports, celebrity, and fashion. This is not the result of some unbridgeable political division. The interpersonal tether that makes possible a form of imagined intimacy among strangers within groups of a significant size was severed and banished from the public sphere. <span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText564"/>The old means of manufacturing a nation, the civic rituals of an educational system, mandatory service in national defense, religion, a shared language, and a thriving and free press have all but been dismantled or withered from neglect and abuse.</p>
			<p class="para-p">Silicon Valley seized an opportunity created by the void that had opened in American national experience. The technology companies that have come to dominate our lives were in many cases small <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_217" role="doc-pagebreak" title="217"/>nations, built around a set of ideals that many young people craved: freedom to build, ownership of their success, and a commitment above all to results. The Sunnyvales, Palo Altos, and Mountain Views of the world were company towns and city-states, walled off from society and offering something that the national project could no longer provide.</p>
			<p class="para-p">Our argument is that the path forward will involve a reconciliation of a commitment to the free market, and its atomization and isolation of individual wants and needs, with the insatiable human desire for some form of collective experience and endeavor. Silicon Valley offered the latter and the rewards of the former. Across the towns, corporate and otherwise, in Santa Clara County, a form of modern-day artistic colony, or technological commune, sprang up. These were internally coherent communities whose corporate campuses attempted to provide for all of the wants and needs of daily life. They were at their core collectivist endeavors, populated by intensely individualistic and freethinking minds. It is true that the communal experience that Silicon Valley firms were selling itself became commoditized. Yet the atomization of daily life in America and the broader West left a lane open for technology firms, including ours, to recruit and retain a generation of talent that wanted to do something other than tinker with financial markets or consult.</p>
			<p class="para-p">Other nations, including many of our geopolitical adversaries, understand the power of affirming shared cultural traditions, mythologies, and values in organizing the efforts of a people. They are far less shy than we are about acknowledging the human need for communal experience. The cultivation of an overly muscular and unthoughtful nationalism has risks. But the rejection of any form of life in common does as well. The reconstruction of a technological republic, in the United States and elsewhere, will require a re-embrace of collective experience, of shared purpose and identity, of civic rituals that are capable of binding us together. The technologies we are building, including the novel forms of AI that may challenge our <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_218" role="doc-pagebreak" title="218"/>present monopoly on creative control in this world, are themselves the product of a culture whose maintenance and development we now, more than ever, cannot afford to abandon. It might have been just and necessary to dismantle the old order. We should now build something together in its place.</p>
