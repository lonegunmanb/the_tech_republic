			<p class="para-pf dropcaps2line char-dropcap-DC" style="text-indent:0;">O<span class="char-first"><span class="fv-allsmallcaps">n September 28, 2011, </span></span>a group of twenty-four U.S. soldiers were on patrol in Helmand province in southern Afghanistan, supporting special forces personnel who were attempting to build relationships with village leaders in the region. <span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText346"/>The stretch of land in central Asia, at the precarious intersection of numerous empires over the course of three millennia, had been the subject of repeated cycles of invasion since at least Alexander the Great in the fourth century B.C., who was himself ambushed and shot by an Afghan archer with an arrow during a campaign across the country from the Khyber Pass in the east to Persia in the west. On that September afternoon, the patrol stopped, and two marines got out of their vehicles to take a look around, likely searching for potential signs of roadside bombs that might have been hidden by Afghan insurgents along their route. Moments later, a bomb detonated, and the marines, wounded badly, fell to the ground. <span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText347"/>James Butz, a twenty-one-year-old army medic from Porter, Indiana, immediately rushed forward to help—not even sparing a moment to gather his own helmet and rifle. <span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText348"/>A second explosion then went off. “Two soldiers were down,” his father later recalled. “<span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText349"/>Jimmy didn’t hesitate.” All three men, Butz as well as the two marines he was running to help, died that day.</p>
			<p class="para-p">The use of roadside bombs, which came to be known as improvised explosive devices, or IEDs, across Afghanistan against American and <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_140" role="doc-pagebreak" title="140"/>allied forces would expand significantly in the months that followed. <span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText350"/>By 2012, more than three thousand service members in the U.S. military had been killed by the handmade bombs that were hidden or buried beneath roads while insurgents waited out of sight to detonate them. <span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText351"/>A total of 14,500 IED attacks against U.S. and allied soldiers occurred across the country in 2012 alone. The bombs, whose explosive material was often made from widely available crop fertilizers, presented an escalating crisis for American forces, which had been sent to Afghanistan to build meaningful relationships and coalitions with local militias, in villages and towns that were scattered across the region—work that required constant travel and interaction with civilians. <span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText352"/>As a U.S. Navy officer who spent years searching for and defusing the bombs later observed, the IEDs forced U.S. soldiers to “confine themselves to massive, armored vehicles and travel at high rates of speed or plow through farmers’ fields to avoid roads entirely.”</p>
			<p class="para-p"><span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText353"/>The U.S. military spent more than $25 billion from 2006 to 2012 in an attempt to develop solutions to counter and defend against the crude explosive devices, which often cost less than $300 to make. The armored personnel carriers that ferried troops across Afghanistan were particularly vulnerable; their protective armor was simply too light to withstand the blasts given off by the roadside bombs that were hidden across the landscape. <span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText354"/>The U.S. Army decided to order a new fleet of vehicles with more substantial and protective ceramic composite material for armor. <span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText355"/>By October 2012, more than twenty-four thousand of the vehicles would be manufactured and sent to the battlefields of Afghanistan and Iraq. In response, however, insurgents simply began building bigger bombs, and ones that could be detonated remotely at greater and therefore safer distances. <span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText356"/>The more powerful explosive devices came to be known as buffalo killers by soldiers in the field for their ability to take out even the larger and more heavily armored vehicles that the military had ordered to respond to the threat.</p>
			<p class="para-p"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_141" role="doc-pagebreak" title="141"/>By 2011, it had become clear to nearly everyone in the U.S. military that better intelligence was needed to assess the safety of particular roads and potential routes across the country, as well as to identify and capture the bomb makers themselves. <span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText357"/>The frustration of so many soldiers and intelligence officers in the field was that they had the information they needed—the records and locations of prior attacks, the types of bomb-making materials that had been used, the fingerprint scans and mobile phone numbers of captured insurgents, and the reports of confidential informants who had been recruited by American intelligence agencies, to name only a few of the data sets that were available. The information was sitting there, in dozens and hundreds of government systems, for anyone with the right clearance to access. The task of stitching it all together, however, into something useful—into something actionable that patrols could use as they planned their next route to visit a neighboring village, or decided which prisoners to question and what information they might provide—was often effectively impossible.</p>
			<p class="para-p">The structural issue was that those designing the army’s software system at the time, including programmers at Lockheed Martin, in Bethesda, Maryland, were too far and too disconnected from the actual users of the software, the soldiers and intelligence analysts, in the field. The gulf, between user and developer, had grown too wide to sustain any sort of productive cycle of rapid iteration and development. The construction of any technology, including military software systems, requires an intimacy between builder and user—an emotional and often physical proximity that for many government contractors in the suburbs of Virginia and Maryland outside Washington, D.C., was as foreign as the Afghan insurgents American troops were fighting a world away. <span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText358"/>In another era, U.S. fighter pilots during World War II would frequently visit the factory of Grumman Corporation, the predecessor of Northrop Grumman in Bethpage, New York, on Long Island, to provide suggestions on the design and construction of the company’s planes, including the F6F <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_142" role="doc-pagebreak" title="142"/>Hellcat, which proved decisive in the air battle over the Pacific, according to the author Arthur L. Herman. In Afghanistan more than half a century later, however, that link between soldier and supplier had withered, if not been severed completely.</p>
			<p class="para-p">With the army’s attempt to build a software system for soldiers in Afghanistan, the reliance on a tangle of contractors and subcontractors—and a yearslong procurement process that often involved more preparation and planning for the construction of software than actual coding—had deprived Lockheed Martin of any real opportunity to incorporate feedback from its users into its development plans for the system. The military’s software project had devolved into a pursuit of an almost abstract conception of what software <i class="char-i">should</i> look like, with far less concern for the actual features and capabilities, the workflows and interface, that would either make the software valuable to someone working all night on a laptop in Kandahar to prepare for a special forces operation the next morning or not.</p>
			<p class="para-p"><span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText359"/>An intelligence officer in Afghanistan with the 82nd Airborne filed a request in November 2011 with a relatively new division within the U.S. Army, the Rapid Equipping Force, which was located in Fort Belvoir, Virginia, just outside Washington, D.C., and had been established in 2002 as an attempt—one of dozens in recent decades—to expedite the development of new weapons, equipment, and software platforms for soldiers on the front lines. The organization’s stated goal had been to acquire or build what soldiers needed within three to six months—a radically ambitious timeline in the world of defense contracting, where new weapons systems often languished in development for years and even decades. The intelligence officer submitted a formal request to the army procurement office in Virginia asking for access to Palantir’s software to help gather and analyze intelligence from the field in Afghanistan in order to counter the growing threat from IEDs. The stakes were high, and growing. <span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText360"/>The officer wrote that the lack of access to Palantir’s software <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_143" role="doc-pagebreak" title="143"/>had led to “operational opportunities missed and unnecessary risk to the force.”</p>
			<p class="para-p">By early 2012, the requests for access to Palantir from soldiers in the field in Afghanistan had begun mounting, with some finding ways to circumvent the layers and bureaucracy of more traditional procurement channels in favor of sending their requests for laptops and software to senior military officers directly. <span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText361"/>In January 2012, for example, an intelligence officer in Afghanistan sent an email to army procurement personnel arguing that the army’s data analysis system was “not making our job easier, while Palantir is giving us an intelligence edge.” The following month, on February 25, 2012, the same officer repeated his request for Palantir, emphasizing the rising stakes of attempting to wage a war without effective software and the growing frustration from soldiers in the field. “<span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText362"/>We aren’t going to sit here and struggle with an ineffective intel system while we’re in the middle of a heavy fight taking casualties,” the intelligence analyst wrote. <span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText363"/>A deputy to James Mattis, who would later become U.S. defense secretary, wrote in an internal request within the defense department for access to our software, according to an article in <i class="char-i">Fortune</i>, “Marines are alive today because of the capability of this system.”</p>
			<p class="para-p">For many even far from the battlefield, the thought of sending soldiers halfway around the world to fight a war, only to hesitate when those same soldiers are telling you they need better equipment in the field to stay alive, was absurd. The more fundamental issue was that a broader public disillusionment with American involvement in Afghanistan, as the years and casualties mounted, began to shape and warp discussions around what resources soldiers needed to do their jobs. We should, however, as a country, be capable of continuing a debate about the appropriateness of military action abroad while remaining unflinching in our commitment to those we have asked to step into harm’s way. If a U.S. marine asks for a better rifle, we should build it. And the same goes for software.</p>
			<p class="para-p"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_144" role="doc-pagebreak" title="144"/>An even more fundamental issue was that the political class setting the agenda in Afghanistan had itself never flown halfway around the world to risk one’s life. <span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText364"/>Over twenty years, nearly 2,500 members of the U.S. military were killed in Afghanistan, in addition to approximately 70,000 of the country’s civilians. <span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText365"/>The conflict would end up costing $2 trillion over two decades, or $300 million every day for twenty years, according to estimates by a research group at Brown University. It has been more than fifty years since the United States abandoned mandatory conscription in 1973, near the end of the Vietnam War. And since then a generation of political elites has essentially enlisted others to fight their wars abroad.</p>

			<p class="para-p"><span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText366"/>As of August 2006, there were only three members of Congress—three out of our 535 U.S. representatives and senators—who had a child serving in the American military. Charles Rangel, who <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_145" role="doc-pagebreak" title="145"/>represented New York City in Congress for nearly five decades from 1971 to 2017 and fought in Korea in the 1950s, has been a lonely proponent of reinstating the draft. He introduced legislation at least seven times in recent decades calling for the resurrection of conscription. <span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText367"/>If a battle abroad “is truly necessary,” he has said, “we must all come together to support and defend our nation.” The current model is utterly unsustainable. We should, as a society, seriously consider moving away from an all-volunteer force and only fight the next war if everyone shares in the risk and the cost.</p>
			<p class="para-p">A battle over which software intelligence platform to use in Afghanistan would continue for years. In the end, it was the individual soldiers and intelligence analysts who needed a better system, and the army’s disinterest in adjusting more quickly when faced with criticism of its own incumbent platform, that began to shift the discussion. <span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText368"/>In the American system, imperfect as it may be, “you get things done by power,” as Patrick Caddell, a political adviser to President Jimmy Carter, once said, and “you get power from having public support.” The soldiers knew what they needed, and their voices would end up being heard. But it was also a little-known federal statute enacted in response to a prior conflict in another era and a different part of the world—a law that would essentially go overlooked for two decades—that helped tip the balance.</p>

			<p class="para-paft">In the early 1990s, shortly after the U.S. military began its aerial bombardment of Iraq and sent troops to defend Kuwait, commanders in the U.S. Air Force identified an urgent, and seemingly unlikely, problem. The most powerful air force in the world, with the most advanced fighter jets ever produced and rocket-propelled missiles that could reach across continents, lacked something far more low-tech and less expensive. The U.S. Air Force personnel who had flooded into Kuwait in the wake of Saddam Hussein’s invasion of <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_146" role="doc-pagebreak" title="146"/>the country did not have enough two-way radios, the handheld devices that were essential for fast communication across the new military bases that the United States was establishing. The radios, the kinds that are used on construction sites and camping trips, were readily available at stores across the country and could be purchased by anyone for less than $20 at a local electronics store.</p>
			<p class="para-p">The solution for the U.S. Air Force seemed simple: buy more. The best available model at the time was made by Motorola, the American electronics giant that was founded in 1928 in Schaumburg, Illinois. A Japanese subsidiary of the company had large quantities in stock of the radios that the air force needed, and an urgent order for thousands of them was placed. Motorola, however, hesitated when it received the request, which was accompanied by a long list of special provisions inserted by U.S. officials, including what the company believed were onerous and unnecessary requirements to produce data on the costs involved in manufacturing the radios. <span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText369"/>The litany of requirements was a standard part of the military procurement process at the time; its ostensible purpose was to ensure that the government received a fair price for what it bought. Motorola did not have anything to hide. The issue was that the company did not have the accounting systems in place that would have enabled it to track its manufacturing costs in the specific way that the U.S. government required. As a result, the company could not lawfully sell its radios to the American military.</p>
			<p class="para-p">The air force was in a bind. A war was mounting in Iraq, and the military did not have sufficient numbers of the most basic of tools—a working, portable communications device. The result seemed absurd. A patchwork of regulations that had been intended to <i class="char-i">protect</i> the U.S. government against overspending were now preventing that same government from buying what it needed on the open market in the middle of the most significant military conflict in a generation. The air force contemplated attempting to navigate through its own regulations and find a work-around. <span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText370"/>But developing an <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_147" role="doc-pagebreak" title="147"/>alternative contractual model, one that would have avoided the cost disclosure requirements mandated by law, “would have taken some time,” according to Lieutenant Colonel Brad Orton, who was leading the air force’s effort to acquire the radios, “time that we didn’t really have.” In the end, Orton and others decided to circumvent the U.S. government’s own regulatory regime entirely. <span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText371"/>They reached out to the Japanese government and arranged for Japan, not the United States, to purchase six thousand of the handheld radios directly from Motorola and then for the Japanese government to send them to the U.S. Air Force in Kuwait.</p>
			<p class="para-p">The episode came to symbolize the extent of internal dysfunction within the U.S. government procurement process, which had become so contorted and inefficient that the military, during wartime, was prevented from buying what any civilian could have purchased from a local electronics store. The challenge was systemic, and the roots of the dysfunction ran deep. <span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText372"/>Senator William Roth, who represented Delaware for three decades beginning in 1971, would later point out the absurdity of the fact that the federal government struggled to purchase products that anyone could “buy at the local Wal-Mart and Kmart.”</p>
			<p class="para-p">The structural issue was that the procurement bureaucracy within the U.S. government had become so large and so entrenched, wielding enormous power and influence, that it had grown used to ordering custom-built versions of whatever it needed instead of shopping for goods, like everyone else, on the open market. The federal procurement officials responsible for supplying the U.S. military could direct the efforts of thousands of subcontractors and suppliers, essentially dictating that anything they wanted or needed be conjured and created from scratch. The government did not technically employ the product designers or own the factories. But it effectively controlled them, and could also pay any price. <span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText373"/>At the time, the U.S. government “tended to spend too much because it had almost everything it bought ‘custom made’ to government or military specifications,” <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_148" role="doc-pagebreak" title="148"/>Al Gore, who worked on procurement reform during his time as vice president under Bill Clinton, wrote in 1998. The U.S. Army, for example, at one point in the 1990s drafted more than seven hundred pages of specifications on how to bake cookies, specifications that would be sent to its suppliers, instead of simply working with a major manufacturer whose cookies were already being made and on grocery store shelves.<a class="char-fnref footnote_ref" epub:type="noteref" href="Karp_9780593798706_epub3_c013_r1.xhtml#_footnote_d1-00015ecf" id="_footnote_referrer_d1-00015ecf" role="doc-noteref" title="footnote">[*]</a></p>
			<p class="para-p">The roots of the problem, as well as the increasing public frustration with wasteful government spending, had been growing for nearly a century. <span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText375"/>A commission established by President Theodore Roosevelt in 1905, for example, had discovered that the U.S. government was purchasing 278 types of pens, 132 variations of pencils, and twenty-eight distinct colors of ink. <span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText376"/>Gifford Pinchot, a close friend of Roosevelt’s who served on the commission, noted that the government had become “debased by generations of political control, sunk in the mire of traditional red tape”—a term that has its roots in the red-colored cloth tape that various governments, including that of the United States, had used throughout history to tie and bundle documents.</p>
			<p class="para-p">In the modern age, the constant rotation of personnel through the government, both in the military and in the civilian branches, incentivized inaction and complacency. In the early 1980s, a series of reports regarding the significant sums paid by the U.S. government for commonplace household items captured national attention, prompting calls for reform. <span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText377"/>In 1983, for example, the U.S. Navy reportedly paid $435 for an “ordinary hammer,” according to a report in the <i class="char-i">New York Times</i> at the time, and $400 for a “thumb-sized plastic knob” that was used in the cockpit of a fighter plane. <span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText378"/>Some of the prices that captured public attention were arguably misleadingly <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_149" role="doc-pagebreak" title="149"/>high. <span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText379"/>The hammers, for example, had been listed on an invoice as costing $435 each, even though that figure had been calculated by assigning a proportion of the labor and overhead involved in the production of more than four hundred other spare parts and pieces of equipment to each individual item delivered on an equal basis—an accounting method that imperfectly divided overhead costs across hundreds of items, including the hammers. Still, the public rightly sensed a system that had grown so large and unwieldy that it was nearly beyond reform, planting the seeds of discontent that have resurfaced today, nearly half a century later, about a Washington establishment focused solely on its own survival at the expense of the public interest and common sense. <span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText380"/>In 1984, a journalist described Joseph Sherick, the inspector general of the U.S. Department of Defense under President Ronald Reagan who had been charged with policing the federal procurement bureaucracy at the time, as an “alligator” patrolling “a ‘swamp’ of mismanagement and abuse at the Pentagon.”</p>
			<hr class="transition"/>
			<div aria-hidden="true" class="para-orn">• • •</div>
			<p class="para-paft">By the early 1990s, the reformers had essentially won the argument, and the public was ready, even eager, to see the size and scale of federal spending cut back. Bill Clinton, who won the presidency in 1992, had pitched himself to the American public as a pragmatic reformer—a Democrat who would trim government, not expand it. <span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText381"/>He would later say, in a State of the Union address during his first term, “We know there’s not a program for every problem.” Clinton cast himself as more closely aligned with skeptics of the federal bureaucracy, not its advocates. <span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText382"/>At a press conference in September 1993, announcing what he had described as a national performance review, which was intended to overhaul the federal bureaucracy, Clinton told reporters, “The Government is broken, and we intend to fix it.” The country was receptive to the message, which had significant <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_150" role="doc-pagebreak" title="150"/>support across party lines. <span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText383"/>David E. Rosenbaum, a political correspondent for the <i class="char-i">Times</i>, wrote the following day, “No one who has tried to fill out a Medicare claim form, get the Internal Revenue Service or the Social Security Administration on the telephone, apply for a Government contract—no one, in short, who has ever been hogtied by Federal red tape—can disagree with Mr. Clinton’s description.”</p>
			<p class="para-p"><span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText384"/>Clinton had been working with members of Congress on both sides of the aisle for months on a new federal statute aimed at reforming the federal procurement process. Shortly after 10:00 a.m. on October 26, 1993, Clinton gathered with his vice president, Al Gore, and others in the Old Executive Office Building at the White House to preview his planned reforms and announce a series of spending cuts to federal programs. The struggle by the air force during the Gulf War to purchase two-way radios from Motorola—and a furtive, last-minute deal with the Japanese government to avert a crisis—was, for Clinton, a clear example of why the U.S. Congress needed to move quickly to overhaul the system. “<span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText385"/>This should never happen again,” Clinton said. <span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText386"/>Gore, who was standing by his side, added, “When the government of another nation has to step in and buy something for the U.S. military because our procurement regulations are so crazy, that’s a clear wake up call.”</p>
			<p class="para-p">The draft legislation that Clinton and others had planned was a bill that would grant the government far more discretion in purchasing decisions. <span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText387"/>The prevailing regulatory regime had focused on price and as a result often led to contracts being awarded to bids that offered the lowest cost irrespective of whether the contractors making them were best suited to do the job. The new legislation shifted the focus to value, as opposed to cost exclusively, providing the government with much broader discretion to make purchasing decisions that it believed were in the public interest. In addition, the bill introduced a new requirement that would essentially remain unused for <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_151" role="doc-pagebreak" title="151"/>more than two decades. The law, which would come to be known as the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act of 1994, required that the government consider buying commercially available products, whether they were two-way radios or armored personnel carriers, before attempting to build something new from scratch.</p>
			<p class="para-p">The legislation attracted little attention at the time; it was the product of a sort of behind-the-scenes governance, without the promise of much publicity, that has lost favor in recent years. The bill was sponsored by John Glenn, the former astronaut and then senator from Ohio. His legacy was secure, and he had little to prove, to his constituents or to the world. Glenn was born in 1921 in Cambridge, Ohio, a small town on the edge of the Appalachian Mountains. He served in the U.S. Marines as a fighter pilot during World War II and later became one of America’s earliest and most celebrated astronauts. By the time he began working on the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act, Glenn was serving his fourth term as a U.S. senator. He was unencumbered by a need to prove something to the public, whose affection he had already secured.</p>
			<p class="para-p"><span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText388"/>At a Senate hearing on February 24, 1994, in which the draft legislation was discussed, Glenn made clear that the proposed law “certainly is not glamorous,” but was rather concerned with what he described as the “ ‘grunt work’ of government, the stuff that makes government work day in and day out, and makes it work efficiently.” Everyone knew that the existing system was broken. But real progress had proven elusive. <span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText389"/>As Glenn pointed out, “We have wrestled year-in and year-out with these same issues, and still have failed to enact any meaningful reform.” <span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText390"/>The strategy of public servants, he added, was often “to just not make waves, to not disturb their careers, to not do anything unusual that might get them in trouble.” And there are a lot of people who do not want to get in trouble. <span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText391"/>Steven Brill, the author and journalist who founded the <i class="char-i">American Lawyer</i> in the late 1970s, has documented the striking scope of the federal <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_152" role="doc-pagebreak" title="152"/>procurement machine, which includes 207,000 federal employees who have been hired to manage government acquisitions and purchases. “The bloat is undeniable,” Brill has written.</p>
			<p class="para-p">In October 1994, the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act was signed into law. At the signing ceremony, Clinton joked that he was hesitant to approve the bill, for fear of depriving late-night comedians of fodder about government dysfunction. “<span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText392"/>What will Jay Leno do?” Clinton asked. “There will be no more $500 hammers, no more $600 toilet seats, no more $10 ashtrays.” The new federal statute, originally codified in Section 2377 of Title 10 of the U.S. Code, required that the U.S. government, “to the maximum extent practicable,” acquire “commercial items,” when such products are readily available on the market, as opposed to attempting to build new products from scratch. The final language of the statute was broad and seemingly unobjectionable—so broad that some believed it would not amount to much. The law merely required that the federal government <i class="char-i">consider</i> purchasing commercially available products before ordering or building something new. The stage was now set for a legal skirmish that would play out two decades later.</p>
			<hr class="transition"/>
			<div aria-hidden="true" class="para-orn">• • •</div>
			<p class="para-paft">In Afghanistan, software made by Palantir had found a committed band of supporters, particularly in the U.S. Special Forces, with teams where intelligence, and the ability to quickly navigate across databases and stitch together context in advance of missions, were critical. But the army as a whole, with hundreds of thousands of active personnel scattered around the world, remained resistant to any sort of broader rollout of Palantir to the force. Its own software program, which the military had been building for more than a decade, was still under development. The Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act, more than twenty years from its passage, with its plain language <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_153" role="doc-pagebreak" title="153"/>requiring that federal agencies consider commercial products before building their own, seemed to present a path forward.</p>
			<p class="para-p">In 2016, Palantir filed a lawsuit in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims, in Washington, D.C., arguing that the army had refused to even consider commercially available alternatives to its own data and analytical platform. <span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText393"/>This sort of litigation was rare, if not nonexistent, because most government contractors were wise enough to avoid suing the government agencies they were hoping would become their customers. We saw things differently. A federal statute had simple, plain language requiring the army to at least consider buying software products that were on the market before attempting to build its own. <span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText394"/>The case came before Marian Blank Horn, who in November 2016 issued a 104-page ruling, concluding that “the Army failed to properly determine…whether there are commercially available items suitable to meet the agency’s needs for the procurement at issue,” and that “the Army acted in an arbitrary and capricious manner” in failing to do so. <span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText395"/>In short, we had won.</p>
			<p class="para-p">In March 2018, the U.S. Army announced that it would be selecting one of two companies, Raytheon and Palantir, to develop its intelligence platform moving forward. <span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText396"/>John McCain, a former officer in the U.S. Navy and then U.S. senator from Arizona, wrote that it was the right decision, that after $3 billion of investment “it was time to find another way.” <span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText397"/>A year later, in March 2019, the army announced that Palantir had won the entire contract. <span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText398"/>The U.S. military’s turn toward the technology sector, and perhaps reluctant embrace of an insurgent startup to take over construction of the system, was, according to the <i class="char-i">Washington Post</i>, “the first time the government had tapped a Silicon Valley software company, as opposed to a traditional military contractor, to lead a defense program of record.” The shift marked a pivot by the U.S. Department of Defense toward software and technology, toward a sector that had repeatedly turned its own back on America and its military in favor of its focus <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_154" role="doc-pagebreak" title="154"/>on, and indeed seemingly boundless enthusiasm for, more easily monetized consumer offerings.</p>
			<p class="para-p">In 2011, while we were sending engineers to Kandahar and working on building a more capable analytical software platform for U.S. and allied intelligence agencies, the focus of Silicon Valley, with its own armies of venture capitalists and entrepreneurs, was far from the mountain passes and deserts of Afghanistan. <span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText399"/>Zynga, the video game maker that had built a following on the back of <i class="char-i">FarmVille</i>, a social-networking game in which players competed to cultivate land and raise livestock, was the darling of the Valley at the time. In December 2011, the company went public at a valuation of $7 billion. The enthusiasm from Wall Street, and focus on monetizing the millions and billions of potential users and clicks for the taking, was palpable. “This is a revolution,” a brokerage firm analyst told the <i class="char-i">Times</i> on the eve of Zynga’s IPO. Afghanistan, and the lonely and often deadly task of clearing dusty roads of hidden bombs, could not have felt farther away.</p>
			<p class="para-p">Zynga was anything but alone in its zeal for and interest in the consumer market. Groupon was another of the year’s most watched IPOs, the darling of darlings with the venture community. The company provided discounts to consumers at local retailers. <span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText400"/>At a valuation of $25 billion, Groupon was set to become “the largest IPO by a venture-backed company in history,” an article at the time in <i class="char-i">Forbes</i> noted. <span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText401"/>The company, which is still in business, albeit barely, has plummeted since its IPO and is today valued at mere pennies for every dollar that it was once worth. The Zyngas and Groupons had the world’s attention. Palantir, by contrast, was off on its own adventure, far from the consumer and, as a result, in the minds of many, the right path. Some employees thought we were foolish. Others left and went to work for this new generation of consumer startups. One early engineer quit because he didn’t think our shares would ever be worth anything and wanted more cash compensation instead of <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_155" role="doc-pagebreak" title="155"/>equity in order to buy a high-end stereo. The market had spoken. And it was unfashionable to question its wisdom.</p>
			<p class="para-p">The technology sector had turned its back on the military, disinterested in wrangling with an overgrown bureaucracy and ambivalence, if not outright opposition, from the public at home. There were other, more lucrative consumer markets to conquer. It was, however, a tolerance and perhaps some degree of taste for conflict, and a stubborn pursuit of something, anything that worked—that engineering instinct—that gave Palantir a foothold.</p>
