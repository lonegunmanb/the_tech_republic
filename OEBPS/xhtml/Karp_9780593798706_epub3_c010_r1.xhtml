			<p class="para-pf dropcaps2line char-dropcap-DC" style="text-indent:0;">O<span class="char-first"><span class="fv-allsmallcaps">n June 26, 1951, </span></span>at around 1:30 p.m., a cluster of honeybees began to form in a park in Munich, Germany. This small swarm of bees would eventually help reshape our understanding of the animal mind and its capacity for undirected cooperation. Martin Lindauer, a researcher at the University of Munich’s Zoological Institute, was on hand that summer afternoon to document the swarm as part of a study on the behavior of the hive and the ability of bees to coordinate among hundreds and even thousands and tens of thousands of individuals. He was captivated by the behavior of the species <i class="char-i">Apis mellifera</i> and was determined to shed light on the delegation of responsibility among individuals within a single bee colony, particularly when they began searching for, and deciding between, new potential nesting sites.</p>
			<p class="para-p"><span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText283"/>Lindauer was born in 1918 in southern Bavaria. His father, who kept beehives as well, was a farmer, and the family had fifteen children. As Hitler rose to power and war engulfed the continent, Lindauer ended up serving in the German army for three years. His interests, however, lay elsewhere, and after suffering an injury on the Russian front in 1942, he was discharged from the military. <span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText284"/>Thomas D. Seeley, a biology professor at Cornell University who has written extensively on Lindauer’s work, has noted that Lindauer once described the scientific community to which he would return after his time in the army <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_116" role="doc-pagebreak" title="116"/>as “a new world of humanity.” The exploration of the natural world was a reprieve for Lindauer, who retreated into science after the war.</p>
			<p class="para-p">He was part of a generation of zoologists whose work preceded the rise and eventual dominance of genetic-based research in the field. For a time during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, the best access that biologists such as Lindauer had into the mind of the animal was through its outward behavior; a more complete understanding of the power and inner workings of the gene, as a means of accessing the nature of a species, was still out of reach. These earlier generations of scientists of the natural world, including the French psychologist Alfred Binet, were observers in the field, and keen ones. The mysteries underlying the behavior of the animals and humans that they were studying, invisible to most, were there for the taking, at least to anyone who was capable of looking closely and for a sufficiently long time.</p>
			<p class="para-p"><span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText285"/>When animals search for a new home, whether geese, leaf-cutter ants, horses, or sparrows, they often venture out as single individuals, and sometimes in pairs, in search of suitable accommodation. The practice of the European honeybee, however, departs significantly from the norm. <span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText286"/>Whereas most animals explore their environments independently, in the case of honeybees “a large community of 20 to 30 thousand individuals <i class="char-i">together</i> move into a new nest-site,” Lindauer wrote—a process that requires immense coordination but without a central queen bee or other specialized leaders directing the work of the group. The process by which tens of thousands of individual organisms manage to organize themselves, canvass potential nesting sites, ultimately select one of a number of options over the rest, and then together move to their new home was an absolute puzzle to Lindauer and his contemporaries.</p>
			<p class="para-p">On this particular summer afternoon in 1951, the collection of bees that Lindauer had been watching was small at first. They had begun congregating not far from an imposing stone statue of Neptune, holding a trident and rising from the waters of a nearby fountain. <span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText287"/>The University of Munich’s Zoological Institute, which had granted <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_117" role="doc-pagebreak" title="117"/>permission to Lindauer to study the bee colonies that the institute maintained, was located in a park that had served as the site of a botanical garden constructed in the early nineteenth century, and there were plenty of secluded and attractive potential nesting sites nearby among the trees and foliage. <span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText288"/>At around three that afternoon, clouds began forming over the park, at which point Lindauer noted that the bees retreated to a nearby bush, where they stayed and spent the night. The following day, after the cloud cover broke and the sun returned, the bees resumed their work of searching for a place to build a hive.</p>
			<p class="para-p">Such searches were involved affairs. They included dozens and sometimes hundreds of scouting bees canvassing potential options nearby. <span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText289"/>The bees return to the group and perform what has come to be known as what Karl von Frisch, an Austrian-born zoologist and colleague of Lindauer’s who would later win a Nobel Prize for his work on the subject, described as a dance language, or <i class="char-i">Tanzsprache</i>—a method of communication by the bees that involved rocking their bodies back and forth in front of onlookers that would gather to watch. Frisch and Lindauer had discovered that the distance of this dance, that is, whether the scouting bee walked for a centimeter or two, for example, was proportional to the distance of the potential nesting site from which they had returned, and therefore indicated how far of a flight it would be to get there. In addition, evidence had begun to accumulate suggesting that the angle of the walk, relative to the position of the sun, indicated the direction of the new nest site. <span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText290"/>Over the course of the afternoon, scouting bees had returned to the main swarm to report eight potential nesting sites in the area, including a crack at the molding on top of a nearby window, a woodpecker hole, and a small hollow in a tree. <span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText291"/>It had become evident to Frisch and Lindauer that individual scouting bees would perform dances in favor of different sites and that the number of scouts that danced in favor of various locations would allow the hive to essentially vote as to the best option.</p>
			<p class="para-p">The bees, for Lindauer, represented something different in nature. <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_118" role="doc-pagebreak" title="118"/>The swarm that he was observing was not merely a collection of discrete individual animals. The precision and extent of their coordination, and lack of any apparent means of centralized management, made clear that the bees formed a discrete system, a coherent whole, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_119" role="doc-pagebreak" title="119"/>whose capacity for assessing and adapting to its surroundings would prompt a reassessment of what constitutes an organism in the decades to come. <span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText292"/>Lindauer narrated the scene with a blend of delicacy and reverence, noting that while two of the eight sites “had already received somewhat more popularity,” “naturally there was not yet any talk of an agreement.” <span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText293"/>On the following day, he noted that the scout bees had seemingly become less enthused about the north site, presumably because something had happened overnight, perhaps a deluge of rainwater that had made the nest unusable.</p>

			<p class="para-p">The swarm adjusted accordingly, and quickly. <span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText294"/>A new batch of potential sites were located by the scouts, some of which, Lindauer wrote, “were only announced by a single dance and received no attention from the population at large,” while “others were lavished with more attention.” <span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText295"/>Over the next several hours, the bees continued to dance in favor of their preferred nesting sites—a blur of intensity and movement through which a collection of thousands of individuals were negotiating and ultimately voting on their top contender for a new home. A particular spot three hundred meters away eventually “emerged as the favorite,” Lindauer reported. The remaining holdouts had relented and given in. The following morning, at 9:40 a.m., Lindauer observed that the entire swarm of bees, having negotiated over the options and settled on a preferred location, “took off and moved into its new home.”</p>
			<p class="para-p">The observations of the Eck Swarm, as it would come to be known, represented a critical moment in our understanding of the behavior of honeybees and their capacity for communication.<a class="char-fnref footnote_ref" epub:type="noteref" href="Karp_9780593798706_epub3_c010_r1.xhtml#_footnote_d1-00015ec0" id="_footnote_referrer_d1-00015ec0" role="doc-noteref" title="footnote">[*]</a> But Lindauer’s work also suggested something more fundamental about the ways in which groups, and indeed extraordinarily large groups of individual animals, have the potential to organize themselves around <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_120" role="doc-pagebreak" title="120"/>a particular problem and respond to changing conditions. <span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText297"/>As one group of researchers has noted, writing on the implications of the collective decision making of honeybees and other animals for human organizations, including nurses and physicians in the health-care field, the social structure of bees demonstrates “coordinated behaviour that emerges without central control.”</p>
			<p class="para-p">The startup, in its ideal form, should become a honeybee swarm. Such coordination and movement, without an overbearing and unnecessarily centralized mechanism of control, is in many ways the single most essential feature of successful startup and engineering cultures in the American context. The bees that Lindauer and others since have studied do not incorporate caste-based social hierarchies in order to address the enormous collective action challenges that they face, but rather distribute autonomy to as great a degree as possible to the fringes—the scouts—of their organization. The individuals at the periphery of a group, who often have the latest and most valuable information regarding the suitability of potential nesting sites, and can take into account shifting conditions, are the ones who cast their ballots by dancing for the group. The swarm <i class="char-i">organizes itself</i> around the problem at hand.</p>
			<p class="para-p">Other species have demonstrated similar patterns of behavior. Giorgio Parisi, an Italian physicist, has studied starlings for years in the hope of understanding the means by which they pass information to one another so quickly and are thus capable of flying in the whirls of flocks that seem to move as a single unit. In December 2005, he and his team set up three cameras on the top of the Palazzo Massimo, a building in central Rome that houses the National Roman Museum. <span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText298"/>Each of the cameras was set to photograph the flocks of starlings that routinely hovered and whirled above the square, taking a total of ten images every second. <span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText299"/>He found that the flocks of birds, which to casual observers are often thought to be spheres or oddly shaped orbs, are actually more like disks. With his ten images every second, and a three-dimensional reconstruction of the birds moving <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_121" role="doc-pagebreak" title="121"/>through space, Parisi’s team was able to map the precise position of each bird in a given flock.</p>
			<p class="para-p">As is the case with the honeybees, the movements of the group of starlings are most often initiated by birds at the edges of the flock, those with a best vantage of potential predators and the world outside—not by preordained leaders or chiefs. Guidance as to which direction the group will be moving is then passed from bird to bird, from the edges of the flock to its core, within a fraction of a second, and shared seamlessly across the entire group of hundreds of individuals. <span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText300"/>As Parisi wrote, messages regarding which way to fly among birds in the flock are shared among them “as if by incredibly rapid word of mouth.”</p>

			<p class="para-paft">At most human organizations, from government bureaucracies to large corporations, an enormous amount of the energy and talent of individuals is directed at jockeying for position, claiming credit for success, and often desperately avoiding blame for failure. The vital and scarce creative output of those involved in an endeavor is far too often misdirected to crafting self-serving hierarchies and patrolling who reports to whom. Among the bees, however, there is no mediation of the information captured by the scouts once they return to the hive. And the starlings do not have to seek permission from higher-ups before they signal to their neighbors that the flock is turning. There are no weekly reports to middle management, no presentations to more senior leaders. No meetings or conference calls to prepare for other meetings. The bee swarms and flocks of starlings do not consist of layers upon layers of vice presidents and deputy vice presidents, directing the work of subgroups of individuals and managing the perceptions of their superiors. There is only the flock or the swarm. And it is within those whirls of motion that a certain type of improvisation, and looseness, is allowed to take form.</p>
