But discussion of the vast realm of questions that afflict our moral lives beyond adherence to the basics—a commitment to equality, of some sort, and certainly the rights of others—was essentially off limits. Any inquiry into what constituted a good or virtuous life, of what allegiance, to one’s country, for example, meant in the modern era, was beyond the meadow of permissible discourse. This generation, the first significant set of graduates from a far more open university system in the United States, was reluctant to limit its options, to exclude the views of others, and to stake out ideological and political stands. The pursuit of optionality, both in their business and in their intellectual lives, if not their personal and romantic choices as well, was paramount. The principal affiliation of this generation of builders was to the businesses they themselves were building. And at school, the subtext of their education from an early age had been that an overly fervent reverence for the American project, let alone the West, should be viewed with skepticism.</p>
			<p class="para-p"><span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText186"/>Amy Gutmann, who taught at Princeton through the 1980s and 1990s, captured the logic of the era when she argued that “our primary moral allegiance is to no community,” national or otherwise, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_70" role="doc-pagebreak" title="70"/>but rather “to justice” itself. The ideal at the time, and still for many today, was for a sort of disembodied morality, one unshackled from the inconvenient particularities of actual life. But this move toward the ethereal, the post-national, and the essentially academic has strained the moral capacity of our species. These cosmopolitan and technological elites in the developed world were citizens of no country; their wealth and capacity for innovation had, in their minds, set them free. <span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText187"/>As Manuel Castells Oliván, a Spanish sociologist, has written, “Elites are cosmopolitan, people are local.” The instinct of this generation of technology founders and programmers was to avoid forgoing paths, taking sides, alienating anybody. This cult of optionality, however, has been crippling, constraining the development of young minds and condemning them to a sort of perpetual preparation for a battle they may never fight. The future belongs to those who scuttle the ships.<a class="char-fnref footnote_ref" epub:type="noteref" href="Karp_9780593798706_epub3_c006_r1.xhtml#_footnote_d1-00015e9c" id="_footnote_referrer_d1-00015e9c" role="doc-noteref" title="footnote">[*1]</a> The ubiquitous off-ramps and backup plans among the current generation, and instinct to burnish the rough edges off of one’s opinions, stand in opposition to throwing oneself into an endeavor with the abandon, nearly reckless, that is required to succeed, or at least fail in a sufficiently substantial way that provokes development.</p>
			<p class="para-p">The current emerging technological class in the United States—the masters of this new universe that we inhabit, willingly or otherwise—often points to software and artificial intelligence as our salvation. They believe, to be sure, but principally in themselves and in the power of their creations, stopping short of entering into a discourse with the most significant questions of our time, including <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_71" role="doc-pagebreak" title="71"/>the broader project of the nation and its reason for being. They are building, but we should ask for what purpose and why. <span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText189"/>President Eisenhower warned in his farewell address in January 1961 of both the rise of a “military-industrial complex” and the “danger that public policy could itself become the captive of a scientific-technological elite.” <span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText190"/>Our current era of innovation has been dominated by the indiscriminate construction of technology by software engineers who are building simply because they can, untethered from a more fundamental purpose.</p>
			<p class="para-p">There is a purity to this desire to construct for the sake of construction. And the amount of sheer creative production is impossible to deny. Mark Zuckerberg, who co-founded Facebook, now Meta, in 2004, demonstrated to the world a level of scaling—from literally dozens to hundreds to thousands to millions to billions of users—that humanity hardly understood to be possible and is still difficult to comprehend. His platform has repeatedly broken through purported ceilings in its potential, confounding supporters and critics alike. After <i class="char-i">The</i> <i class="char-i">Social Network</i> was released in 2010, Zuckerberg took issue with the film’s attempt to frame his interest in building what would become Facebook as a desire for status or even the affections of the opposite sex. “<span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText191"/>They just can’t wrap their head around the idea that someone might build something because they like building things,” he said at a talk at Stanford University in October 2010. He captured the views of a generation of software engineers and founders, whose principal and animating interest was the act of creation itself—decoupled from any grand worldview or political project. These were the technological agnostics.</p>
			<p class="para-p">Our educational institutions and broader culture have enabled a new class of leaders who are not merely neutral, or agnostic, but whose capacity for forming their own authentic beliefs about the world has been severely diminished. And that absence leaves them vulnerable to becoming instruments for the plans and designs of others. An entire generation is at risk of being deprived of the opportunity to <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_72" role="doc-pagebreak" title="72"/>think critically about the world or its place in it. It is this <i class="char-i">productization</i> of the American mind, in addition to its closing, that we must guard against. A significant subset of Silicon Valley today undoubtedly scorns the masses for their attachment to guns and religion, but that subset clings to something else—a thin and meager secular ideology that masquerades as thought.</p>
			<p class="para-p">It may be axiomatic in contemporary culture that all views should be tolerated, but we need to admit that even the faintest whiff of actual religion in certain circles, unironic belief in something greater—in many corporate boardrooms and certainly the halls of our most selective colleges and universities—is looked down upon as essentially preindustrial and retrograde. This shift has been happening for decades. The elite’s intolerance of religious belief is perhaps one of the most telling signs that its political project constitutes a less open intellectual movement than many within it would claim. <span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText192"/>As Stephen L. Carter, a professor at Yale Law School, wrote in his book <i class="char-i">The</i> <i class="char-i">Culture of Disbelief</i>, published in 1993, from the perspective of the educated ruling class in this country, “taking religion seriously is something that only those wild-eyed zealots do.” <span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText193"/>Carter noted that the roots of the contemporary skepticism of religion are essentially modern, beginning with Freud perhaps, who viewed religion as a sort of obsessive impulse. <span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText194"/>In an essay titled “Obsessive Actions and Religious Practices,” published in 1907, Freud wrote that the “formation of a religion,” with its oscillating focus on guilt and atonement from sin, itself “seems to be based on the suppression, the renunciation, of certain instinctual impulses.” It is perhaps that same hostility, often flagrant, to religion in elite culture that holds back the development of belief in the current generation.</p>
			<p class="para-p">There is no question that an unwillingness to revise one’s views in light of new evidence is itself an impediment to progress. <span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText195"/>As the German physicist Max Planck said, “A new scientific truth does not triumph by convincing its opponents and making them see the light, but rather because its opponents finally die.” The miracle of the West <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_73" role="doc-pagebreak" title="73"/>is its unrelenting faith in science. That faith, however, has perhaps crowded out something equally important, the encouragement of intellectual courage, which sometimes requires the fostering of belief or conviction in the absence of evidence.</p>
			<p class="para-p">We have grown too eager to banish any sentiment or expression of values from the public square. The educated class in the United States was content to abstain from engagement with the content of the American national project: What is this nation? What are our values? And for what do we stand? This great secularization of postwar America was cheered by many on the left, either privately or publicly, who saw the systematic eradication of religion from public life as a victory for inclusion. And a victory, in that sense, it was. But the unintended consequence of this assault on religion was the eradication of any space for belief at all—any room for the expression of values or normative ideas about who we were, or should become, as a nation. <span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText196"/>The soul of the country was at stake, having been abandoned in the name of inclusivity. The problem is that tolerance of everything often constitutes belief in nothing.</p>
			<p class="para-p">We unwittingly deprived ourselves of the opportunity to critique any aspects of culture, because all cultures, and by extension all cultural values, were sacred. After decades of debate, the postmodernist impulse has run its course and exposed its limits. <span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText197"/>As Fukuyama has written, “If all beliefs are equally true or historically contingent, if the belief in reason is simply an ethnocentric Western prejudice, then there is no superior moral position from which to judge even the most abhorrent practices—as well as, of course, no epistemological basis for postmodernism itself.” The postwar move to stamp out belief in America was an overcorrection and left us vulnerable as a society. Was America nothing more than a vehicle through which a newly globalized and educated elite could enrich itself?</p>
			<p class="para-p">Amid the ongoing assault on belief, many Americans have remained essentially ambivalent about the move—not because they are zealots or harbor secret prejudices. They are rather rightly wary <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_74" role="doc-pagebreak" title="74"/>and skeptical of the constraints that had been placed on their ability to speak affirmatively on any number of issues, given that speech and language were now being patrolled by bands of secular warriors for any potential violations, however slight, of the new prime directive—which was to offend no one and, consequently, to tread cautiously whenever advocating for a view that might privilege one way of life, one set of values, over another. As a formal matter, dissent was still tolerated. But such tolerance was fickle, and indeed shallow and thin.</p>

			<p class="para-paft">The employees at Google who resisted leveraging the machinery of their company in service of building software for the U.S. military know what they oppose but not what they are for. The problem that we are describing is not a principled commitment to pacifism or nonviolence. It is a more fundamental abandonment of belief in anything. The company, at its core, builds elaborate and extraordinarily lucrative mechanisms to monetize the placement of advertising for consumer goods and services that accompany search results. The service is vital and has remade the world. But the business, and a significant subset of its employees, stop short of engaging with more essential questions of national purpose and identity—with an affirmative vision of what we want to and should be building as part of a national project, not simply an articulation of the lines that one will not cross. They remain content to monetize our search histories even as they decline to defend our collective security.</p>
			<p class="para-p">Google, of course, along with any number of Silicon Valley’s largest technology enterprises, owes its existence in significant part to the educational culture, as well as the legal protections and capital markets, of the United States. The personal computer itself, as well as the internet, was the result of military funding and support in the 1960s from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, a division of the U.S. Department of Defense. <span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText198"/>In her book <i class="char-i">The Entrepreneurial State</i>, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_75" role="doc-pagebreak" title="75"/>Mariana Mazzucato, an economics professor at University College London, calls out this collective amnesia in the Valley, noting that the U.S. military’s role has “been forgotten” by this era’s software titans, who have rewritten history in order to place themselves at its center and exclude and diminish the role of government in fostering and sustaining innovation. And in the absence of any larger project for which to fight, many simply turned elsewhere, not out of some moral failing, but because of the transformation of our most hallowed educational institutions into administrative caretakers, not vessels of culture.</p>

			<p class="para-p">Our reluctance to take on the larger questions has left an enormous amount of talent and zeal on the sidelines. Entire swaths of our generation’s greatest minds have drifted, some more willingly than others, into a narrow subset of industries. <span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText199"/>A survey conducted in 2023 of graduating seniors at Harvard University, for instance, found that nearly half of the entire class was headed for jobs in finance and consulting. <span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText200"/>Only 6 percent of graduates of Harvard College in 1971 went into those two professions after graduation, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_76" role="doc-pagebreak" title="76"/>according to an analysis by the <i class="char-i">Harvard Crimson</i>. That proportion rose steadily in the 1970s and 1980s, peaking at 47 percent in 2007 just before the financial crisis.</p>
			<p class="para-p">The instrumentalization of American higher education continues unchecked. <span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText201"/>The number of graduating college seniors who earned a degree in the humanities fell from 14 percent in 1966 to 7 percent in 2010. <span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText202"/>At the same time, enrollment in computer science and engineering majors has been rising steadily over the past decade, with 51,696 students majoring in those fields in 2014 and 112,720 students in 2023, more than doubling. We need engineers who are engaged with and curious about the world, the movement of history and its contradictions, not merely skilled at programming.</p>
			<p class="para-p">The market has spoken, we tell ourselves, essentially abdicating responsibility for this massive shift in the ambitions and direction of a generation of capable and well-meaning minds. Some graduates, of course, are convinced that they are involved in a broader project. But the mere association of oneself with an ideology or political movement—and resulting feeling of adjacency to engagement and proximity to action—too often masquerade as actual belief or thought. Results need to matter. <span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText203"/>As Henry Kissinger reminded us, nations “should be judged on what they did, not on their domestic ideology.”<a class="char-fnref footnote_ref" epub:type="noteref" href="Karp_9780593798706_epub3_c006_r1.xhtml#_footnote_d1-00015ea1" id="_footnote_referrer_d1-00015ea1" role="doc-noteref" title="footnote">[*2]</a> The systematic expression and investigation of one’s own beliefs—the essential purpose of genuine education—remain our best defense against the mind becoming a product or vehicle for the ambitions of another.</p>

			<p class="para-paft">Earlier we invoked the F-35 fighter jet manufactured by Lockheed Martin, with its anticipated cost of $2 trillion, which includes <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_77" role="doc-pagebreak" title="77"/>components, from engines to wings, that are manufactured in nearly every one of the fifty U.S. states. <span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText204"/>The airplanes are made from 300,000 individual parts that are produced by more than eleven hundred suppliers. <span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText205"/>The parts include $100,000 titanium and aluminum panels that cover the outside of the fuselage made in Phoenix, an $11 million engine made by Pratt &amp; Whitney in East Hartford, Connecticut, and a $300,000 air compressor from a company in Fort Wayne that enables the release of bombs. The breadth and distribution of that supply chain, and its economic benefits, are part of the reason Congress has continued to vote in favor of the program’s extension and funding. But what will happen when the defense products of the future, including the artificial intelligence software that will enable the battles of this century, are made by an increasingly concentrated set of companies in Silicon Valley—a sliver of land in a single part of the country? How will the state ensure that this engineering elite remains subservient and accountable to the public?</p>
			<p class="para-p"><span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText206"/>The fifty most valuable technology companies in the world were worth a combined $24.8 trillion as of 2024. American firms accounted for 86 percent of that total value, or $21.4 trillion. In other words, the United States is responsible for generating nearly nine out of every ten dollars in value of the world’s top technology companies. And of those fifty firms, nearly all of the most valuable ones—including Apple ($3.5 trillion), Microsoft ($3.2 trillion), Nvidia ($3.0 trillion), Alphabet ($2.1 trillion), Amazon ($2.0 trillion), Meta ($1.4 trillion), and Tesla ($0.8 trillion)—have roots either in Silicon Valley or on the West Coast. And that level of concentration of wealth and influence—a level that has never before been seen in modern economic history—is only set to increase.<a class="char-fnref footnote_ref" epub:type="noteref" href="Karp_9780593798706_epub3_c006_r1.xhtml#_footnote_d1-00015ea3" id="_footnote_referrer_d1-00015ea3" role="doc-noteref" title="footnote">[*3]</a></p>
			<p class="para-p">We have made the mistake of allowing a technocratic ruling class <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_78" role="doc-pagebreak" title="78"/>to form and take hold in this country without asking for anything quite substantial in return. What should the public demand for abandoning the threat of revolt? The engineers and entrepreneurs of the Valley have been permitted vast license over broad swaths of the economy, but what should the public ask for in exchange? Free email is not enough.</p>

			<p class="para-p">The broader risk for any country is that elite power structures harden and calcify. In <i class="char-i">The Protestant Establishment</i>, published in 1964, the sociologist E. Digby Baltzell articulated an argument that might feel uncomfortably close to that of many in this country’s ruling class today.<a class="char-fnref footnote_ref" epub:type="noteref" href="Karp_9780593798706_epub3_c006_r1.xhtml#_footnote_d1-00015ea4" id="_footnote_referrer_d1-00015ea4" role="doc-noteref" title="footnote">[*4]</a> In Baltzell’s view, an aristocracy driven by talent is <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_79" role="doc-pagebreak" title="79"/>an essential feature of any republic. The challenge is ensuring that such aristocracies remain open to new members and do not descend into mere caste structures, which close their ranks along racial or religious lines. “<span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText209"/>If an upper class degenerates into a caste,” Baltzell wrote, “the traditional authority of an establishment is in grave danger of disintegrating, while society becomes a field for careerists seeking success and affluence.” The challenge for any organization, and indeed nation, is finding ways of empowering a group of leaders without incentivizing them to spend more effort guarding the trappings and perquisites of office than advancing the goals of the group. The caste structures that have formed within countless organizations around the world—from federal bureaucracies to international agencies to academic institutions and Silicon Valley technology giants—must be challenged and dismantled if those institutions have any hope of survival over the long term.</p>
			<p class="para-p">In the end, the nation, this collective attempt at not merely self-governance but the construction of a shared and common life if not purpose, will decide whether it wants Silicon Valley to believe in anything other than the power of its own creations. The technology companies that this country has built have for the most part deftly navigated around any issues that would draw undue scrutiny or unwanted attention; the hallmark of their mode of being is avoidance and, often, silence.</p>
			<p class="para-p">The current silence is a symptom of a broader reluctance to offend and to permit ourselves and those around us to err. In one particularly haunting scene from George Orwell’s <i class="char-i">1984</i>, Winston Smith, his protagonist, finds himself wandering through a wooded area, seemingly far from the reach of the state’s dystopian minders. <span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText210"/>Even then, secluded and almost assuredly free from observation, Smith imagines that a microphone might be concealed in the trees, through which “some small, beetle-like man” would be “listening intently.” The scene is only nearly fiction. <span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText211"/>In East Germany, the state security service, known as the Stasi, was rumored to have placed microphones <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_80" role="doc-pagebreak" title="80"/>in the trees over ping-pong tables in Berlin’s parks, to catch snippets of conversations.</p>
			<p class="para-p">The dystopian future that Orwell and others have imagined may be near, but not because of the surveillance state or contraptions built by Silicon Valley giants that rob us of our privacy or most intimate moments alone. It is we, not our technical creations, who are to blame for failing to encourage and enable the radical act of belief in something above and beyond, and external to, the self. The speed and enthusiasm with which the culture skewers anyone for their perceived transgressions and errors—with which we descend on one another for deviations from the norm—only further diminishes our capacity to move toward truth.</p>
			<p class="para-p">The reluctance of several generations of educators, in particular, but also our political and business leaders, to venture into a discussion about the good, as opposed to merely the right, has left a gap that risks being filled by others, demagogues from both the left and the right.<a class="char-fnref footnote_ref" epub:type="noteref" href="Karp_9780593798706_epub3_c006_r1.xhtml#_footnote_d1-00023737" id="_footnote_referrer_d1-00023737" role="doc-noteref" title="footnote">[*5]</a> Such reluctance was born of a desire to accommodate all views and values. But a tolerance of everything has the tendency to devolve into support of nothing. The antiseptic nature of modern discourse, dominated by an unwavering commitment to justice but deeply wary when it comes to substantive positions on the good life, is a product of our own reluctance, and indeed fear, to offend, to alienate, and to risk the disapproval of the crowd. Yet there is too much that lies “beyond justice,” in the words of Ágnes Heller, the Hungarian philosopher born in Budapest in 1929. <span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText212"/>As Heller writes, “Justice is the skeleton: the good life is the flesh and blood.” The implications for everything from technology to art are significant.</p>
			<p class="para-p"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_81" role="doc-pagebreak" title="81"/>We have withdrawn just as much from making ethical judgments about the good life as we have aesthetic judgments about beauty. <span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText213"/>The postmodern disinclination to make normative claims and value judgments has begun to erode our collective ability to make descriptive claims about truth as well. In <i class="char-i">The Twilight of American Culture</i>, Morris Berman acknowledged that “the deconstructionists were right,” in the sense that the context in which a text is written certainly matters, as does its author, and that much of what had passed for <i class="char-i">objective</i> inquiry in academia and elsewhere had been just the opposite. “<span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText214"/>The problem arises when this position is pushed to the limit,” he wrote, “such that you abandon the search for truth and even deny it exists, repudiate the reality of history and intellectual tradition.” Our present unwillingness to pronounce, to have a view, and to venture toward the flame, not away from it, risks leaving us adrift.</p>
			<p class="para-p">In a different era, and when confronted with a different sort of test, the American public—enraptured as it was with the prosecutorial zeal and proselytizing of Joseph R. McCarthy, the junior senator from Wisconsin—ultimately came to the conclusion that its purported shepherd was corrupt. We must again look inward, not to our political leaders, many of whom have been complicit in our present descent, but to us, the public itself, for failing to rise up, for failing to resist the hollowing out of our American mind. On March 9, 1954, Edward R. Murrow, the legendary CBS broadcaster of the age, delivered his blistering critique of Senator McCarthy, helping close the chapter on the crusader’s particularly enthralling and virulent form of persecution. As Murrow reminded us, quoting Shakespeare’s <i class="char-i">Julius Caesar</i>, “The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars, but in ourselves.”</p>
			<p class="para-p">The challenge today will again require a public reckoning with the wisdom of continuing an intellectual war on the concept of the nation, and perhaps nationality itself, that was begun a century ago and <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_82" role="doc-pagebreak" title="82"/>whose effects can still be seen today. What began as a noble search for a more inclusive conception of national identity and belonging—and a bid to render the concept of “the West” open to any entrants interested in advancing its ideals—over time expanded into a more far-reaching rejection of collective identity itself. And that rejection of any broader political project, or sense of the community to which one must belong in order to accomplish anything substantial, is what now risks leaving us rudderless and without direction.</p>
