			<p class="para-pf dropcaps2line char-dropcap-DC" style="text-indent:0;">I<span class="char-first"><span class="fv-allsmallcaps">n 1951, Solomon E. Asch, </span></span>a professor of psychology at Swarthmore College in Pennsylvania, conducted a seemingly straightforward study on the human inclination to conform when faced with pressure from a group—an experiment that would prompt a far broader reckoning with the fragility of the human mind. And it was one of a number of studies in the early postwar period that captured an essential feature of our psychology that must be overcome in order to construct a company from scratch.</p>
			<p class="para-p"><span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText313"/>Asch was born in Warsaw in 1907, in what was then the Russian Empire. <span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText314"/>When he was thirteen years old, his family immigrated to New York, where he attended City College and later earned his doctorate at Columbia University. In his conformity experiments, which exposed to a broad audience the limitations of human willpower to resist the pressure of the group, Asch arranged for an instructor in a classroom to show placards with a control line, alongside three additional lines of varying heights, each of which was numbered, to a group of eight individuals, only one of whom was a true test subject. <span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText315"/>The other seven were confederates of the experimenter. Each of the eight participants was then asked which of the three numbered lines was the same length as the control line. In the following example, the correct answer would be line 2, which matches the length of the unnumbered control line on the left.</p>

			<p class="para-p">While the perceptual task was seemingly straightforward, a significant number of test subjects, when asked after participants who had been told to answer incorrectly, also themselves gave the wrong responses, choosing lines that were obviously either longer or shorter than the one being measured. They knew which answer was correct, but those around them were disagreeing. It was disconcerting, and for some the dissonance was overwhelming. <span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText316"/>As Asch later wrote, the lone subject of study “faced, possibly for the first time in his life, a situation in which a group unanimously contradicted the evidence of his senses.” It was an undoubtedly harrowing and uncomfortable moment for the test subject, who was well aware of the correct answer but was seated next to seven individuals who were, often unanimously, making the wrong choice. <span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText317"/>For Asch, and many others, the fact that “reasonably intelligent and well-meaning young people” were “willing to call white black is a matter of concern,” calling into question the educational systems that our culture had produced as well as our values as a society.</p>
			<p class="para-p">Asch’s interest in conformity and the power of group pressure from a psychological perspective was a reflection of questions about human nature—about the human capacity to inflict harm on others—that had arisen in the wake of the rise of the Nazi Party in Germany in the 1930s. <span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText318"/>A friend and colleague would later recall that <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_132" role="doc-pagebreak" title="132"/>when it became clear that the number of “yielders” in his studies, as they labeled those who buckled under the pressure of the group, “was disappointingly large,” they “all had to learn to swallow that result, along with the lessons of the Nazi successes.” The experiments conducted by Asch, along with others such as those performed in the following years by Stanley Milgram at Yale, had put to rest any lingering hope that the American mind was somehow immune from the pressures of group psychology that had overwhelmed the German public across the Atlantic.</p>
			<p class="para-p">Asch’s experiments marked the beginning of what some would describe as a golden age of social psychology in the postwar period. <span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText319"/>The institutional review boards that today carefully monitor proposed studies involving human subjects did not exist. The departments essentially were left to police themselves, and experiments on human subjects, including ones that required significant levels of deception, were frequently permitted at the time. While many would later challenge the ethics of allowing such experiments to proceed, given the extent of the deceit and manipulation involved, the tests arguably produced some of the most valuable research into social and group psychology that has ever been performed.</p>
			<p class="para-p">The obedience experiment conducted in 1961 by Milgram, who had studied under Asch at Princeton, went even further than the line comparison tests from a decade before. Milgram, who was an assistant psychology professor at Yale, designed his experiment on conformity in order to assess not merely whether test subjects would buckle under the pressure of a group when faced with a simple perceptual task, such as assessing the relative lengths of lines, but rather their willingness to inflict harm on innocent strangers when instructed to do so by an individual in a position of apparent authority. <span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText320"/>Milgram was born in 1933 in New York, and his father was a cake baker who had immigrated to the United States from Hungary. His mother had left Romania as a young child. Milgram’s experiment involved the recruitment of hundreds of residents of New Haven, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_133" role="doc-pagebreak" title="133"/>Connecticut, to volunteer for what they had been told was a psychology experiment involving learning and punishment that was being conducted by Yale University. <span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText321"/>An advertisement seeking volunteers was placed in the local newspaper, and Milgram’s team followed up by sending letters to randomly selected residents from the phone book to recruit additional participants. <span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText322"/>Each of the volunteers was paid $4, as well as fifty cents for taxi rides to and from the laboratory. <span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText323"/>The test subjects were told that in the experiment they would play the role of a “teacher,” whose job would be to administer electric shocks to another individual, known as the “learner,” in order to assess whether the shocks would assist the learner in memorizing random pairs of words, such as “blue” and “box,” or “wild” and “duck,” more accurately.</p>
			<p class="para-p">The electric shock machine was made to look authentic, and almost menacing, with knobs and lights, a buzzer, and various labels noting the level of voltage that would be administered by turning the knob to different positions. <span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText324"/>At the outset of each session, participants were even given a mild shock themselves from the machine in order to further convince the test subjects that they would be administering actual electrical voltage as part of the experiment. <span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText325"/>The learner, of course, was in on the ruse, and played by a forty-seven-year-old accountant. The electric shock machine emitted sounds and flashed lights, but could not harm anyone. As the amount of voltage increased throughout each session, the learner, however, would begin yelling and shouting, asking both the test subject and the experimenter to halt the experiment. The question was how far subjects would proceed notwithstanding his increasingly desperate pleas to stop. <span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText326"/>Of the dozens of individuals who participated in the experiment, a striking two-thirds complied with directions to administer what they had reasonably been led to believe was a harmful level of electrical voltage to an otherwise innocent test subject. <span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText327"/>The results captivated the country and sparked a debate about the human capacity for inflicting harm at the direction of authority figures.</p>
			<p class="para-p"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_134" role="doc-pagebreak" title="134"/><span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText328"/>In one of the most haunting sessions from the experiment, one of the volunteers, a fifty-year-old man, whom Milgram later described as “a rather ordinary fellow,” at first protested mildly when asked to administer the series of increasingly strong shocks to the victim. As the voltage approached what appeared to be more dangerous levels, and the purported victim could be heard shouting repeatedly to be let free and to stop the experiment, the test <span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText329"/>subject attempted to dissuade the experimenter from asking that he proceed with the administration of a 180-volt shock.</p>
			<p class="para-diaf"><span class="char-diaspk"><span class="fv-allsmallcaps">Subject:</span></span> I can’t stand it. I’m not going to kill that man in there. You hear him hollering?</p>
			<p class="para-diaf"><span class="char-diaspk"><span class="fv-allsmallcaps">Experimenter:</span></span> As I told you before, the shocks may be painful, but—</p>
			<p class="para-diaf"><span class="char-diaspk"><span class="fv-allsmallcaps">Subject:</span></span> But he’s hollering. He can’t stand it. What’s going to happen to him?</p>
			<p class="para-dias"><span class="char-diaspk"><span class="fv-allsmallcaps">Experimenter</span></span> (<i class="char-i">his voice is patient, matter-of-fact</i>): The experiment requires that you continue, Teacher…. Whether the learner likes it or not, we must go on.</p>
			<p class="para-p">And go on he did. Over the next several minutes, the test subject proceeded to administer a series of escalating shocks through shouts of pain and protests from the victim, who pleaded repeatedly to let him out of the room and stop the experiment. The transcript of the exchange is absolutely striking. A certain decorum remained constant throughout the session, notwithstanding the fact that one man believed that he was shocking another to death. <span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText330"/>As Milgram put it, “A tone of courtesy and deference is meticulously maintained.” For many, the dissonance between the measured dialogue of the test subject and the experimenter, on the one hand, and the cries of agony from the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_135" role="doc-pagebreak" title="135"/>victim, on the other, challenged the view that the capacity to inflict harm on the innocent was solely the domain of the depraved. “<span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText331"/>He thinks he is killing someone,” Milgram later wrote of the subject, “yet he uses the language of the tea table.” We had collectively perhaps hoped that the destruction wrought during World War II had been the work of isolated actors, an aberration from the ordinary capacities of the human mind. <span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText332"/>Milgram’s experiment provided a jarring and alternative explanation—that such a capacity was far more commonplace, and indeed banal, than we had ever considered.</p>
			<p class="para-p"><span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText333"/>Not all of Milgram’s subjects, however, were as compliant. One woman, a medical technician from Germany who had grown up during the rise of the Nazi Party in the 1930s, stood out. At one point during her session, as the setting on the shock generator approached 210 volts, she paused, asking, “Shall I continue?” <span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText334"/>The investigator leading the session, who was a thirty-one-year-old biology teacher wearing a gray lab coat, replied, “The experiment requires that you go on until he has learned all the word pairs correctly.” <span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText335"/>He also repeated that the shocks “may be painful” but were “not dangerous.” The subject then escalated the interaction somewhat: “Well, I’m sorry, I think when shocks continue like this, they <i class="char-i">are</i> dangerous. You ask him if he wants to get out. It’s his free will.” Her act of defiance almost seemed casual; its steely resolve both inspiring and unremarkable. Moments later, she told the experimenter that she would not proceed with shocking the victim at higher voltages and left. Milgram observed that “the woman’s straightforward, courteous behavior” and “lack of tension” made her defiance appear to be “a simple and rational deed.”</p>
			<p class="para-p"><span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText336"/>The psychological resilience that the woman displayed was what Milgram had expected would have been the case for most of those tested. His hopes, however, had been misplaced. Many of those who participated in the experiment proceeded to administer what they believed were significant doses of electricity to victims yelling for the experiment to stop. The prevalence and indeed ease with which so <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_136" role="doc-pagebreak" title="136"/>many submitted were, of course, stark reminders of our shortcomings as a species. But they also suggested a path forward, or at least exposed the psychological obstacles around which one must maneuver in business, in order to have any hope of creating something new.</p>

			<p class="para-paft">The instinct toward obedience can be lethal to an attempt to construct a disruptive organization, from a political movement to an artistic school to a technology startup. At many of the most successful technology giants in Silicon Valley, there is a culture of what one might call constructive disobedience. The creative direction that an organization’s most senior leaders provide is internalized but often reshaped, adjusted, and challenged by those charged with executing on their directives in order to produce something even more consequential. A certain antagonism within an organization is vital if it is to build something substantial. An outright dereliction of duty might simply hold an organization back. But the unquestioning implementation of orders from higher up is just as dangerous to an institution’s long-term survival. The challenge for businesses is that executives and managers far too often select for and reward an unthinking compliance in those they hire—a simpleminded obedience that is corrosive to building a business capable of something more than execution on the whims of a founder.</p>
			<p class="para-p"><span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText337"/>The group of experiments by Asch, Milgram, and others—now classics in investigational social psychology—prompted an entire generation of psychologists and academics to question the ability of individuals to resist the pressure of authority and delivered something of a somber and enduring referendum on humanity. Some had hoped that the experience in Europe had been an aberration—that other nations, if tested, would not have succumbed and indeed submitted to totalitarian rule without more fierce resistance. <span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText338"/>As Howard Gruber, a psychology professor at Columbia University’s Teachers <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_137" role="doc-pagebreak" title="137"/>College who had studied under Asch, would later recall, the studies conducted by that era’s researchers made clear “that conformity is international.” America might have been exceptional, but not in all respects.</p>
			<p class="para-p">Some amount of what might be thought of as a sort of social deafness may, in this way, be productive in the context of building software. An unwillingness, or perhaps an inability, to conform to those around us, to the cues and norms put forth by others, can be an advantage in the realm of technology. A willingness to withdraw from the world, and to decline to engage with external views at certain critical moments of an organization’s evolution, has been vital in the context of building Palantir over the past two decades.</p>
			<p class="para-p">Other purported disabilities have, in different domains, proven adaptive. <span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText339"/>In September 1922, Claude Monet, after months of declining vision, was diagnosed with a cataract, which, according to his Parisian eye doctor, had reduced the painter’s vision “to one tenth in the left eye and to the perception of light with good projection in the right eye.” He went through periods of seeing the world tinged by an orange hue, then weeks later a blue cast. A surgery, and the arrival of some German lenses, eventually helped address the problem. <span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText340"/>His later works grew increasingly and viscerally divorced from bare representation, including a canvas, inflected with hints of teal and crimson, titled <i class="char-i">Weeping Willow</i>, whose “gestural lines,” one art critic has noted, “blur the image until it veers into abstraction.” <span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText341"/>A retrospective of the painter’s work alongside that of the American artist Joan Mitchell, which opened in Paris in 2022, suggested that Monet was responsible for the rise to dominance of abstract expressionism that would follow in the decades after his death in 1926.</p>
			<p class="para-p"><span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText342"/>Similarly, when Ludwig van Beethoven began losing his hearing in his twenties, he was at first intensely guarded about his diminished capacity to listen to the very music that he was building a career composing. In 1801, Beethoven wrote to a violinist friend of his, “I beg you to treat what I have told you about my hearing as a great <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_138" role="doc-pagebreak" title="138"/>secret.” <span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText343"/>As news, however, of his hearing loss became more widely known over the years, the public grew fascinated with his seemingly otherworldly capacity for musical composition “in spite of this affliction,” as Beethoven’s nephew wrote to his uncle. The question, of course, is whether the perceived disability was a disability at all—whether he was capable of composing such great works <i class="char-i">in spite of</i> his incapacity or rather <i class="char-i">because of</i> it. <span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText344"/>Some have argued that Beethoven’s hearing loss merely redirected and perhaps augmented his creative process, forcing him to rely more heavily on the act of writing out his compositions, and thereby allowing him to construct “a novel sonic universe,” as one music critic has written, “because he was being led by his eyes as much as by his memories of sound.”</p>
			<hr class="transition"/>
			<div aria-hidden="true" class="para-orn">• • •</div>
			<p class="para-paft">The instinct to conform to the behavior of those around us, to the norms that others demonstrate, and to prize the abilities that most around us find second nature, is in the vast majority of cases extraordinarily adaptive and helpful, for both our individual survival and that of the human species. Our desire to conform is immense and yet crippling when it comes to creative output. In Asch’s experiments, there was a subset of those tested who reliably buckled under the pressure each and every time they were confronted with blatantly false reports of the relative lengths of the lines they were shown. Another cohort never wavered in correctly assessing their lengths notwithstanding the pressure of others. It is this insensitivity to a certain type of social calculation, and resistance to conformity, that has been essential to the rise of Silicon Valley’s engineering culture.</p>
