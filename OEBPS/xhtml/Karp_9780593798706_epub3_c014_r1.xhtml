			<p class="para-pf dropcaps2line char-dropcap-DC" style="text-indent:0;">T<span class="char-first"><span class="fv-allsmallcaps">he American artist </span></span>Thomas Hart Benton, who painted murals in the early part of the twentieth century, declined to jettison his representational approach even as modernism seemed to be sweeping away forms of art that could be readily deciphered. <span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText402"/>He taught at the Art Students League of New York for years, and his most famous student, Jackson Pollock, seemed ambivalent about his teacher’s influence; the two had a long tangle of a friendship. <span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText403"/>In an interview with <i class="char-i">Art and Architecture</i> magazine in 1944, Pollock offered a bit of begrudging praise for his former instructor, explaining that “it was better to have worked with him than with a less resistant personality.” <span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText404"/>Benton initially thought little of Pollock’s canvases, describing them as “paint-spilling innovations” and “scorned the idea of their possessing any long-term value.”</p>
			<p class="para-p">The modern enterprise is often too quick to avoid such friction. We have today privileged a kind of ease in corporate life, a culture of agreeableness that can move institutions away, not toward, creative output. The impulse—indeed rush—to smooth over any hint of conflict within businesses and government agencies is misguided, leaving many with the misimpression that a life of ease awaits and rewarding those whose principal desire is the approval of others. <span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText405"/>As the comedian John Mulaney has said, “Likability is a jail.”</p>
			<p class="para-p">The casual and unrelenting pressure to revert to the mean, to do <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_157" role="doc-pagebreak" title="157"/>what has been done before, to eliminate the wrong types of risks from a business at precisely the wrong times, and to avoid confrontation is everywhere and often tempting. But the culture’s move to accommodate the subjective reality of its students and employees has only inflamed the sense of grievance and affliction that some feel. The rise of trigger warnings and other forms of acquiescence behind which the left has zealously rallied for more than a decade has backfired spectacularly, by fostering a sense of harm that often does not exist. <span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText406"/>Richard Alan Friedman, a professor of clinical psychiatry at Weil Cornell Medical College, said in an interview that, beginning in 2016 or so, he began seeing an increase in reports of students alleging that they had been “harmed by things that were unfamiliar and uncomfortable,” and that the language they used, describing unease upon hearing comments in class, for example, “seemed inflated relative to the actual harm that could be done.”</p>
			<p class="para-p">This is a grievance industry, and it is at risk of depriving a generation of the fierceness and sense of proportion that are essential to becoming a full participant in this world. A certain psychological resilience and indeed indifference to the opinion of others are required if one is to have any hope of building something substantial and differentiated. <span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText407"/>The artist and the founder alike are often “the mad ones,” as Jack Kerouac wrote in <i class="char-i">On the Road</i>, “the ones who are mad to live, mad to talk, mad to be saved, desirous of everything at the same time.” The challenge, of course, is that some of the most compelling and authentic nonconformists, the artists and iconoclasts, make for notoriously difficult colleagues.</p>
			<p class="para-p">In the context of a creative endeavor, such as a technology startup or an artistic movement, the blank slate of human desire poses a fundamental challenge. We instinctively look to one another for guidance as to what is desirable, and as a consequence the intentions of others are often adopted wholesale and without reflection, left to grow within ourselves. René Girard, the French anthropologist, observed the conflicts and rivalries between monkeys that arise when <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_158" role="doc-pagebreak" title="158"/>one member within a group selects a single banana out of many, all of which are identical. “<span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText408"/>There is nothing special about the disputed banana,” Girard said in an interview in 1983, “except that the first to choose selected it, and this initial selection, however casual, triggered a chain reaction of mimetic desire that made that one banana seem preferable to all others.”</p>
			<p class="para-p">Our earliest encounters with learning are through mimicry. But at some point, that mimicry becomes toxic to creativity. Some never make the transition from a sort of creative infancy. Much of what passes for innovation in Silicon Valley is, of course, something less—more an attempt to replicate what has worked or at least was perceived to have worked in the past. This mimicry can sometimes yield fruit. But more often than not it is derivative and retrograde. The best investors and founders are sensitive to this distinction and survive because they have actively resisted the urge to construct imperfect imitations of prior successes. The act of rebellion that involves building something from nothing—whether it is a poem from a blank page, a painting from a canvas, or software code on a screen—by definition requires a rejection of what has come before. It involves the bracing conclusion that something new is necessary. The hubris involved in the act of creation—that determination that all that has been produced to date, the sum product of humanity’s output, is not precisely what ought or need be built at a given moment—is present within every founder or artist.<a class="char-fnref footnote_ref" epub:type="noteref" href="Karp_9780593798706_epub3_c014_r1.xhtml#_footnote_d1-0001c28c" id="_footnote_referrer_d1-0001c28c" role="doc-noteref" title="footnote">[*1]</a></p>
			<p class="para-p">For a startup, or any organization that seeks to challenge an incumbent, the sort of mindless conformity that dominates modern commerce—an unwillingness to risk the disapproval of the crowd—<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_159" role="doc-pagebreak" title="159"/>can be lethal. In 1841, Ralph Waldo Emerson published “Self-Reliance,” his enduring broadside against religious dogmatism, in which he railed against individual weakness in the face of institutional pressure. “<span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText410"/>For nonconformity,” he reminds us, “the world whips you with its displeasure.” Emerson made clear that the desire to conform not merely to those around you but to one’s prior views on a subject can be just as limiting and indeed hobbling. The permanence of our thoughts and writing on the internet for all time—and the zeal with which the crowd confronts individuals who dare to venture into public life with perceived inconsistencies in their prior statements—only risk confining us further, into a straitjacket of our former selves. <span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText411"/>But Emerson is right to ask, “Why drag about this corpse of your memory, lest you contradict somewhat you have stated in this or that public place?…Leave your theory, as Joseph his coat in the hand of the harlot, and flee.” We count ourselves among those who have repeatedly fled, abandoning failed projects within days of a lack of progress being surfaced and deconstructing dysfunctional teams. At other times, we certainly have been more timid, proceeding far too cautiously to reverse prior judgments and investments, in both particular people and projects. But the public, investing and otherwise, is often far too unforgiving of retreats and pivots, of revisions to plans and missteps. Nothing of consequence is built in a straight line. A voracious pragmatism is needed, as well as a willingness to bend one’s model of the world to the evidence at hand, not bend the evidence.</p>

			<p class="para-paft">When Isaiah Berlin wrote his essay <i class="char-i">The Hedgehog and the Fox</i>, in 1953, the computing revolution was still far off. But there is no question that the ferocity of Silicon Valley’s ascent, and by extension that of the United States, stems in significant part from the culture of the small tract of land south of San Francisco, in which an almost <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_160" role="doc-pagebreak" title="160"/>ruthless pragmatism took hold. <span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText412"/>For Berlin, there was a “great chasm” between the hedgehogs among us in the world, “who relate everything to a single central vision, one system less or more coherent or articulate, in terms of which they understand, think and feel,” and the foxes, “who pursue many ends, often unrelated and even contradictory, connected, if at all, only in some de facto way.” Berlin built something rich and enduring upon the thinnest of foundations—a single line, a fragment of a poem from the Greek poet Archilochus, who was born on an island in the middle of the Aegean Sea in the early seventh century B.C. “<span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText413"/>The fox knows many things,” Archilochus wrote, “but the hedgehog knows one big thing.” And Silicon Valley is the consummate fox.</p>
			<p class="para-p">The founders and technologists who have constructed and will continue to construct the modern world willingly abandoned grand theories and overarching belief structures to build, indeed often build anything, as long as it worked. The distinguishing feature of technology, and in particular software, is that either it runs or it does not. There is no halfway, no <i class="char-i">almost</i>, when it comes to software. The programmer is confronted with failure immediately. No amount of discussion or posturing can change whether the program performed as it should. <span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText414"/>Herbert Hoover, who studied geology at Stanford University, worked in the mining industry for nearly two decades, first during the gold rush in the 1890s in Western Australia, then a British colony, and later in Tianjin, China. <span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText415"/>He wrote in his memoirs that the “great liability of the engineer compared to men of other professions is that his works are out in the open where all can see them,” and that the engineer “cannot bury his mistakes in the grave like the doctors,” or “argue them into thin air or blame the judge like the lawyers.” It is this sensitivity to results, and to failure, and perhaps an abandonment of grand theories of how the world ought to be, or how things ought to work, that is the seed of an engineering culture.</p>
			<p class="para-p">It is essential that the engineer—whether of the mechanical <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_161" role="doc-pagebreak" title="161"/>world, the digital, or even perhaps the written—descend from his or her tower of theory into the morass of actual details as they exist, not as they have been theorized to be. <span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText416"/>One must, as the American philosopher John Dewey wrote in his essay “Pragmatic America” in 1922, “get down from noble aloofness into the muddy stream of concrete things.”<a class="char-fnref footnote_ref" epub:type="noteref" href="Karp_9780593798706_epub3_c014_r1.xhtml#_footnote_d1-00015ed9" id="_footnote_referrer_d1-00015ed9" role="doc-noteref" title="footnote">[*2]</a> An emotional and often physical proximity to the mess of imperfections and apparent contradictions of the systems and processes that one is charged with shaping is the source of progress, not its impediment. <span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText418"/>A commitment to this sort of pragmatism, or indeed the engineering mindset that has given rise to the Valley, “discourages dogmatism,” as Dewey wrote, “arouses and heartens an experimental spirit which wants to know how systems and theories work before giving complete adhesion,” and “militates against too sweeping and easy generalizations.”</p>
			<p class="para-p">A certain ravenous pragmatism and insensitivity to calculation had been lost on the current generation. After the end of World War II, U.S. defense and intelligence agencies launched a massive and secret effort to recruit Nazi scientists, in order to retain an advantage in the coming years in developing rockets and jet engines. <span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText419"/>At least sixteen hundred German scientists and their families were relocated to the United States. Some were skeptical about this late embrace of the former enemy. <span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText420"/>An officer in the U.S. Air Force urged his commander to set aside any distaste for recruiting the German scientists to this new cause, writing in a letter that there was an immense amount to be learned from this “German-born information,” if only “we are not too proud.”</p>

			<p class="para-paft"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_162" role="doc-pagebreak" title="162"/><span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText421"/>In his book <i class="char-i">Expert Political Judgment</i>, published in 2005, Philip E. Tetlock, a professor of psychology at the University of Pennsylvania, recounted being shown a demonstration in the 1970s that “pitted the predictive abilities of a classroom of Yale undergraduates against those of a single Norwegian rat.” The challenge was to determine on which side of a small maze, left or right, a piece of food would be hidden. The experimenters would place food on the left side of the maze 60 percent of the time and the right side 40 percent of the time using a randomized selection process. The Yale students watched the rat attempt to ferret out the food, puzzling over potential patterns and grander schemes that might have lurked behind its placement. The rat, however, simply wanted to eat. And it turns out, the rat, not the undergraduates, was better at predicting where the food would be.</p>
			<p class="para-p"><span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText422"/>As Tetlock explained, the human mind was bested by the animal in the maze study “because we are, deep down, deterministic thinkers with an aversion to probabilistic strategies that accept the inevitability of error.” The search for grand theories, for underlying systems and mechanisms of action in the world, in any other number of domains, from physics to medicine, has provided us with an enormous advantage, Tetlock acknowledged. <span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText423"/>Eugene Wigner, a theoretical physicist who was born in Budapest in 1902, famously observed the “uncanny usefulness of mathematical concepts.” <span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText424"/>But that same drive for systematic theories of the world, for coherence at the expense of an effective muddle, has also left us with a persistent blind spot and resistance to embracing the instruction that the universe provides, even if its internal logic may be beyond us.</p>
			<p class="para-p">Tetlock’s broader interest and project involved testing the accuracy of predictions made by political experts when confronted with questions about developments in global affairs. <span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText425"/>He and his team solicited and compiled a total of 27,451 forecasts made by experts starting in the 1980s, covering a range of political questions from the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_163" role="doc-pagebreak" title="163"/>fate of the Soviet Union, whether South Africa would continue to maintain minority rule, and if Quebec would secede from Canada. <span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText426"/>Tetlock was interested in assessing which experts, among his panel, would be able to “ ‘beat’ the dart-throwing chimp” in making predictions about future historical events. <span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText427"/>It turns out that the 284 experts, that is, the academics and policy wonks selected to participate in Tetlock’s study over the course of nearly two decades, did not generally fare better than chance. Some of the nearly three hundred experts, however, did outperform.</p>
			<p class="para-p">Tetlock had divided his specialists into groups of thinkers—foxes and hedgehogs—based on their responses to survey questions regarding the way that they approached intellectual challenges and problem-solving. And the foxes won.</p>

And Tetlock did. <span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText429"/>But he also posed other questions to the experts, including whether they believed politics was more “cloudlike” or “clocklike,” in an effort to tease out some of the same types of instincts. Those who described politics and history as more like a cloud than a clock, with its mechanistic precision and regularity, turned out to be significantly better predictors. <span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText430"/>The “worst performers,” according to Tetlock, “were hedgehog extremists making long-term predictions in their domains of expertise.”</p>

			<p class="para-paft"><span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText431"/>In the late 1970s, Taiichi Ohno, a senior executive at Toyota Motor Corporation, published a book describing the Japanese automaker’s reinvention of industrial manufacturing and articulated an approach to root-cause analysis that we adopted nearly twenty years ago and continue to use to this day. The method of inquiry has been essential in our ability to identify the fundamental, rather than superficial, causes of issues that inevitably arise across a company. <span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText432"/>The approach, on its face, is straightforward: ask why a problem occurred, and then ask why again four more times. We and others call it, very inventively, of course, the Five Whys. <span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText433"/>In the context of an industrial manufacturing facility, Ohno provided an example of a machine that stopped working because of an overloaded fuse, which upon further inquiry had been caused by a broken pump and ultimately worn metal parts.</p>
			<p class="para-p"><span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText434"/>For Ohno, who was born in 1912 in Manchuria just after the fall of the Qing dynasty, the method of inquiry focused on identifying the engineering flaws at the root of a problem. <span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText435"/>His father worked for the South Manchuria Railway, which was operated across an outpost of the Japanese empire in northeast China. Identifying the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_165" role="doc-pagebreak" title="165"/>reasons for the failure of a system, whether it be an enterprise software platform or an assembly line for internal combustion engines, necessarily requires a focus on the inner workings and mechanics of the system at issue.</p>
			<p class="para-p">At Palantir, we build on this method of inquiry to incorporate an analysis and indeed acknowledgment of the human systems that are precursors to the software that we are building. Why did an essential update to an enterprise software platform not ship by a Friday deadline? Because the team had only two days to review the draft code. Why did the team have only two days to review? Because it had lost six software engineers in the budget review cycle late last year. Why did its budget decrease? Because the head of the group had shifted priorities elsewhere at the request of another group lead. Why was the request made to shift priorities? Because a new compensation model had been rolled out incentivizing growth in certain areas over others. And one can go even further, of course. Why were certain areas selected at the expense of others? Because of an ongoing feud at the company between two senior executives.</p>
			<p class="para-p">In this example, a missed deadline for shipping an update to a software system was, at its root, caused not by an individual engineer’s oversight or even the team’s failure to think ahead, but rather by an ongoing and increasingly adversarial interpersonal conflict at the highest rungs of the company. This sort of corporate butterfly effect is anything but new to those whose professions require subjecting oneself and submitting to the vicissitudes of modern corporate life. But what we have found is that those who are willing to chase the causal thread, and really follow it where it leads, can often unravel the knots that hold organizations back. It takes persistence and a willingness to dig beyond the first layers of a problem. The psychological dispositions and decision-making instincts of leaders within the company are often at the core of the challenge.</p>
			<p class="para-p">The exercise works most effectively if those involved resist the urge to assign blame to their colleagues and instead focus on the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_166" role="doc-pagebreak" title="166"/>structural—and indeed often interpersonal—issues that gave rise to the mistakes at hand. We have conducted thousands of these Five Whys reviews over the past twenty years and draft detailed written reports that attempt to document, without assigning blame to individuals, the systemic and root causes of the problems that arise. The reasons for any complex system’s failure, human and otherwise, can often feel beyond reach because of the difficulty, and patience required, of tracing the multiple and related chains of causation that lead through the labyrinth of the institutions and incentives we construct. A mistake, such as a missed deadline or lackluster product launch, often finds its root in the tangle of human relationships that make up the organization involved in the endeavor. The approach is an outgrowth of an engineering culture that at its best is unwaveringly focused on understanding what is working well and what is not. The challenge is fostering a sufficiently gentle and forgiving internal culture that encourages the most talented and high-integrity minds within an organization to come forward and report problems rather than hide them. Most companies are populated with people so fearful of losing their jobs that any hint of dysfunction is quickly covered up. Others are simply trying to make it to their retirement without being discovered as providing little or no value to the organization. Many more are monetizing the decline of empires they had once built.</p>
			<p class="para-p">It is a willingness to respond to the world as it is, not as we wish it might be, that has been a principal reason that the latest generation of Silicon Valley behemoths have come as far as they have. <span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText436"/>As Lucian Freud, the German-born figurative painter, perhaps the most enduring of the twentieth century, put it, “I try to paint what is actually there.” The act of observation, of looking closely while suspending judgment—taking the facts in and resisting the urge to impose one’s view on them—sits at the heart of any engineering culture, including ours. Freud, who was born in Berlin in 1922, was the grandson of Sigmund Freud, the psychoanalyst whose <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_167" role="doc-pagebreak" title="167"/>interrogations of the human mind transformed our willingness and ability to investigate our own psychology. The act of penetrating observation was essential to Lucian’s portraits, which he has described as a sort of negotiation between artist and subject. They are unsparing and quite intimate, both bracing and gentle. His gaze, long and patient, sits at the heart of his work. <span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText437"/>Martin Gayford, a British art critic, has said that Freud “revived the figurative tradition” in the last century, a tradition that had fallen out of favor and was at risk of being eclipsed entirely. <span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText438"/>The artist once told an interviewer, “It can be extraordinary how much you can learn from someone, and perhaps about yourself, by looking very carefully at them, without judgment.” It is this approach to observation, to looking closely at the clouds around us, while suspending judgment, that forms the foundation of the engineering mindset. The challenge we now face, in rebuilding a technological republic, is directing that engineering instinct, an indeed ruthless pragmatism, toward the nation’s shared goals, which can be identified only if we take the risk of defining who we are or aspire to be.</p>
