			<p class="para-pf dropcaps2line char-dropcap-DC" style="text-indent:0;">I<span class="char-first"><span class="fv-allsmallcaps">n December 1976, </span></span>at a meeting of the American Historical Association in Washington, D.C., Fredric L. Cheyette, a professor of medieval European history at Amherst College, delivered an address calling for the abandonment of the canonical courses on Western civilization that had once been a required rite of passage for undergraduates in American higher education. The debate regarding the survey courses, affectionately and often otherwise known as Western Civ, had been gathering momentum on college campuses for decades, particularly after the end of the war in the 1950s and 1960s.</p>
			<p class="para-p">The question was what, if anything, undergraduates at the country’s colleges and universities should learn about Western civilization—about ancient Rome and Greece, through the emergence of the modern form of the nation-state in Europe, and onto our own experiment in the new republic of America. More fundamentally, the issue was whether the concept itself of Western civilization was coherent and substantial enough to hold real meaning in the educational context. The courses spawned an entire subculture of debate about their role and place on campus for nearly half a century, a debate which would become a harbinger of the cultural divide that continues to reveal itself today. And the history of their demise, lost to many in the Valley, suggests the roots of our current predicament. <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_84" role="doc-pagebreak" title="84"/>The issue was not merely what college students ought to be taught, but rather what the purpose of their education was, beyond merely enriching those fortunate enough to attend the right school. What were the values of our society, beyond tolerance and a respect for the rights of others? What role did higher education have, if any, in articulating a collective sense of identity that was capable of serving as the foundation for a broader sense of cohesion and shared purpose? The generations that would go on to build Silicon Valley, to spur the computing revolution, came of age during what would become a massive reassessment of the value of the nation and indeed the West itself.</p>
			<p class="para-p">The traditionalists argued that undergraduates required some basic exposure to thinkers and writers such as Plato and John Stuart Mill, if not also Dante and Marx, in order to understand the freedoms that those students themselves enjoyed and the place in the world that they inhabited. The urge by many at the time to construct a coherent narrative from an enormously fractured historical and cultural record was immense. <span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText215"/>The supporters of a core curriculum in the Western tradition argued somewhat pragmatically that the American republic required the construction of a shared patrimony or sense of American identity among a cultural elite that was increasingly drawing from a more diverse swath of the population. <span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText216"/>William McNeill, for example, a historian who began teaching at the University of Chicago in 1947, argued that the construction of a unified canon of texts and narratives, if not mythologies, gave students “a sense of common citizenship and participation in a community of reason, a belief in careers open to talent, and a faith in a truth susceptible to enlargement and improvement generation after generation.” The virtue of a core curriculum situated around the Western tradition was that it facilitated and indeed made possible the construction of a national identity in the United States from a fractured and disparate set of cultural experiences—a form of civic religion, tethered largely to truth and history across the centuries but <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_85" role="doc-pagebreak" title="85"/>also aspirational in its desire to provide coherence to and grounding of a national endeavor.</p>
			<p class="para-p">Those opposed to the aging survey courses, including Cheyette at Amherst, argued against what they believed was an essentially fictitious grand narrative regarding the arc and development of Western civilization, making the case that such a curriculum was too exclusionary and incomplete to impose on students. <span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText217"/>Kwame Anthony Appiah, a professor of philosophy at New York University and critic of the entire conception of “the West,” would later argue that “we forged a grand narrative about Athenian democracy, the Magna Carta, Copernican revolution, and so on,” building to the crescendo of a conclusion, notwithstanding evidence to the contrary, that “Western culture was, at its core, individualistic and democratic and liberty-minded and tolerant and progressive and rational and scientific.” For Appiah and many others, the idealized form of the West was a story, riveting perhaps and compelling at times, but a narrative nonetheless, and one that had been imposed, and awkwardly foisted and fitted, onto the historical record, rather than emerging from it.</p>
			<p class="para-p">It was also, of course, very much in dispute where “the West” was even located, that is, which countries counted. When Samuel Huntington published his essay “The Clash of Civilizations?” in <i class="char-i">Foreign Affairs</i> in 1993, he included a map of Europe with a line that William Wallace, then a research fellow at Oxford University, had argued showed the extent of Western Christianity’s advance as of 1500.</p>
			<p class="para-p">Most scholars resisted what they described as Huntington’s facile division of the world into seven, or possibly eight, discrete “civilizations.”<a class="char-fnref footnote_ref" epub:type="noteref" href="Karp_9780593798706_epub3_c007_r1.xhtml#_footnote_d1-00015ea9" id="_footnote_referrer_d1-00015ea9" role="doc-noteref" title="footnote">[*1]</a> But while his frame was certainly reductionist—indeed, its appeal stemmed from its apparent precision—the wholesale revolt against Huntington would end up crowding out most <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_86" role="doc-pagebreak" title="86"/>serious normative discussions about the role of culture in shaping everything from international relations to economic development. Where were the fault lines between cultures? Which cultures were aligned with the advancement of the interests of their publics? And what should be the role of the nation in articulating or defending a sense of national culture? The entire terrain would become verboten to scholars who had thoughts of tenure.</p>

			<p class="para-paft">By the late 1970s, the traditionalists had lost the battle, if not the war as well. “<span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText219"/>There is not <i class="char-i">a</i> history,” Cheyette told his colleagues at the meeting of the American Historical Association in Washington, but rather “many possible histories.” Cheyette was anything but a radical. <span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText220"/>He was born in New York City in 1932 and attended Princeton after graduating from Mercersburg Academy, a private boarding school in Pennsylvania that had been founded at the end of the nineteenth century. He completed his doctorate at Harvard and, in 1963, became a professor of European history at Amherst, where he would teach for nearly fifty years. <span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText221"/>Cheyette’s academic interests tended toward the conservative, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_87" role="doc-pagebreak" title="87"/>as well as the more obscure corners of European history, in particular the eleventh and twelfth centuries of medieval France. In this way, Cheyette was himself a member of the academic establishment that he was seeking to challenge, and his call for reform was indicative of the broad support within the academy for dismantling the old regime of required survey courses on Western civilization—a category of history and thought whose internal coherence Cheyette and others came to believe was insufficient to justify mandatory attendance by incoming freshmen. <span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText222"/>He articulated the dominant critique of such courses at the time when he described to his academic peers “the realization that what had passed for universal was itself sectarian.”</p>
			<p class="para-p">The retreat had been gathering pace for years. The first earnest challenges to the dominance of courses on Western civilization in the United States had arisen a decade before the meeting in Washington, after the convulsions of the 1960s prompted many to ask whose history was being told and taught. <span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText223"/>In some cases, as one observer recounted, the courses “died a natural death, and in others were simply murdered.” <span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText224"/>At Stanford, for example, the History of Western Civilization had been a required course for years after the end of World War II, introducing students to a discrete and curated selection of work, from Plato and Rousseau to Marx and Arendt. <span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText225"/>But in November 1968, a ten-person committee decided to abandon the requirement. The group, which consisted principally of academic administrators and professors, but also an undergraduate philosophy student, a nod perhaps to the democratic ethos of the moment, concluded in its report that such courses, which had been modeled on similar programs at Columbia and the University of Chicago, were “dead or dying.” The world, including the United States, had been remade following the end of World War II. Only months before Stanford decided to retire its iconic survey course, Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert F. Kennedy had been assassinated. During the prior winter, North Vietnamese forces had launched the Tet Offensive against South Vietnam, which by many accounts would <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_88" role="doc-pagebreak" title="88"/>prove to be the beginning of the end of American involvement in the war. The dissonance between the convulsions of the decade and academia’s desire to cling to what many believed was a vestige of a past that might never have existed had become too much.</p>
			<p class="para-p"><span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText226"/>The course at Stanford ended the following year, in 1969, going out, according to an article in the school’s student newspaper at the time, “with a whimper and not a bang.” The resistance on campus to dismantling the old regime of a required canon was muted, if not wholly disempowered, at the end. <span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText227"/>As one historian noted, by the late 1960s, once the challenge to educational requirements had gained momentum, students “encountered faculties already prepared to retreat.” To many critics, the apparent arbitrariness of the editorial process of developing a syllabus for a course as ambitious as the History of Western Civilization—and selection of only a small handful of works for inclusion from such an enormous list of candidates—was alone reason to abandon the project. “<span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText228"/>We have Plato, but why not Aristotle?” asked Joseph Tussman, the head of the philosophy department at the University of California, Berkeley, in an essay published in 1968. “Why not more Euripides? <i class="char-i">Paradise Lost</i>, but why not Dante? John Stuart Mill, but why not Marx?”</p>
			<p class="para-p">Such editorial disputes, however, masked the far more fundamental questions that the canon wars had exposed, and the significance of what was at stake. The survey course had flourished for decades on the premise that the American academy, along with its students, required grounding in a broader historical context, tethering the political and cultural developments of the United States to antecedents in Europe and antiquity. <span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText229"/>As a member of a faculty review board assembled by the American Historical Association in the 1890s had noted, “American history is in the air—a balloon sailing in mid-heaven—unless it is anchored to European history.” The balloon, however, was now cut loose.</p>

			<div aria-hidden="true" class="para-orn">• • •</div>
			<p class="para-paft"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_89" role="doc-pagebreak" title="89"/>How did we get here? <span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText230"/>The current conception of “the West,” as meaning a set of cultural and political values rooted in antiquity and extending through history to the modern era, began to take shape in the late nineteenth century. Its meaning would shift and evolve over the years, but rightly came to cohere around a set of shared practices or traditions that made possible, and indeed bearable, collective existence at a grand scale. <span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText231"/>As Winston Churchill observed in 1938, in a speech at the University of Bristol on the west coast of England, civilization “means a society based upon the opinion of civilians,” that “violence, the rule of warriors and despotic chiefs, the conditions of camps and warfare, of riot and tyranny, give place to parliaments where laws are made, and independent courts of justice in which over long periods those laws are maintained.” For Churchill, the rise of civilization makes possible “a wider and less harassed life” to the public.</p>
			<p class="para-p">Many have argued that the entire concept should be abandoned—that the imperfect and shifting descriptive power of “the West,” if any, is overwhelmed by its historical tether to imperial theories of domination, of superiority and the subjugation of colonial subjects at the periphery of empire.<a class="char-fnref footnote_ref" epub:type="noteref" href="Karp_9780593798706_epub3_c007_r1.xhtml#_footnote_d1-00015eac" id="_footnote_referrer_d1-00015eac" role="doc-noteref" title="footnote">[*2]</a> <span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText233"/>Appiah, for example, has argued in favor of abandoning the “idea of western civilisation,” which for him has been “at best the source of a great deal of confusion” and “at worst an obstacle to facing some of the great political challenges of our time.” The West, for Appiah and many others, became an object of moral scorn, impeding our understanding of history, burdening the task of interpretation with a cumbersome narrative architecture that obscured more than it enlightened. The edifice, they argued, must be torn down.</p>
			<p class="para-p">The deconstruction of and challenge to a monolithic and wholly <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_90" role="doc-pagebreak" title="90"/>coherent conception of Western civilization began in earnest in the 1960s but arguably culminated with the publication of Edward Said’s <i class="char-i">Orientalism</i> in 1978. <span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText234"/>Adam Shatz, the U.S. editor of the <i class="char-i">London Review of Books</i>, argued in a 2019 essay, four decades after <i class="char-i">Orientalism</i> was first published, that the book was “one of the most influential works of intellectual history of the postwar era.” A group of critiques that had been gaining ground for years seamlessly cohered around Said’s treatise, which became the vehicle through which academia would be remade.</p>
			<p class="para-p">It would indeed be difficult to overstate the power and sheer cultural force of Said’s creation. The term “Orientalist” itself became an epithet of sorts among a certain swath of the ascendant cultural elite—a weapon that continues to have the ability to arrest a discussion in its tracks and a term that ironically itself became a means of constructing identity and exercising power on college campuses. <span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText235"/>As Shatz put it, the term “Orientalism,” nearly half a century after its popularization by Said, “has become one of those words that shuts down conversation on liberal campuses, where no one wants to be accused of being ‘Orientalist’ any more than they want to be called racist, sexist, homophobic, or transphobic.” The book’s legacy, however, has been more complicated. One form of dogmatism, rooted in a colonial outlook, would soon be replaced by others, often similarly dismissive of competing notions of history and literature that transgressed against the new received wisdom. In the same way that the Orientalists of the nineteenth century and before had delineated certain cultures and peoples as having little to contribute, and as being less than equal to the privileged core of civilization, the academic establishment in the 1980s and 1990s would find in the wake of Said its own means of identifying and indeed <i class="char-i">othering</i> certain arguments as being unworthy of critical engagement.</p>
			<p class="para-p">The book also reshaped the machinery and internal politics of humanities departments across the United States and around the world. <span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText236"/>The author Pankaj Mishra has written that <i class="char-i">Orientalism</i> “launched a <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_91" role="doc-pagebreak" title="91"/>thousand academic careers.” <span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText237"/>Indeed, the book gave birth to a new industry in American higher education, built around dismantling colonial understandings of the world, and at the same time, Mishra has argued, provided a means of self-promotion for a subset of “intellectual émigrés, largely male,” who “were often members of ruling classes in their respective countries—even of classes that had flourished during colonial rule.” As Mishra put it, “For a posher kind of Oriental subject, denouncing the Orientalist West had become one way of finding a tenured job in it.”</p>
			<p class="para-p">The effect of <i class="char-i">Orientalism</i> on the culture was so thorough and complete, so totalizing, that many today, particularly in Silicon Valley, are scarcely aware of its role in shaping and structuring contemporary discourse, as well as their own views about the world. <span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText238"/>In his biography of Said, <i class="char-i">Places of Mind</i>, Timothy Brennan writes that beginning in the late 1990s, “postcolonial studies was no longer simply an academic field,” but rather an entire worldview, with a highly particularized jargon, including “ ‘the other,’ ‘hybridity,’ ‘difference,’ ‘Eurocentrism’ ”—terms that “could now be found in theater programs and publishers’ lists, museum catalogs, and even Hollywood film.” Indeed, a broad swath of intellectuals in the United States, and many of those adjacent to academia, including writers and journalists, situated their own politics—a politics that would emerge as the dominant form of elite establishment thinking in the United States through the 1990s and into this century, including in Silicon Valley—around a book that many would never encounter directly, and some of whom did and do not know exists.</p>
			<p class="para-p">The substantive triumph of <i class="char-i">Orientalism</i> was its exposing to a broad audience the extent to which the telling of history, the act of summation and synthesis into narrative from disparate strands of detail and fact, was not itself a neutral, disinterested act, but rather an exercise of power in the world. <span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText239"/>As Said himself explained in an afterword to the book, written in 1994, “The construction of identity is bound up with the disposition of power and powerlessness in each <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_92" role="doc-pagebreak" title="92"/>society, and is therefore anything but mere academic woolgathering.” In this way, the engine and mechanism of the production of history and anthropology were the objects of Said’s study. And it was the inclination of that engine toward division, toward definition of the “us” and the “other,” that for Said was itself a consequence and perhaps necessary component of the act of observation. <span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText240"/>As Said made clear, citing the British historian Denys Hay, “the idea of Europe” was “a collective notion identifying ‘us’ Europeans as against all ‘those’ non-Europeans.” After nearly half a century, the observation seems unobjectionable and almost banal. But it was absolutely radical in the 1970s, destabilizing an entire academic mode of being across the university establishment. His central thesis provides the basis for much of what passes as foundational in the humanities today, that the identity of a speaker is as important if not more important than what he or she has said. The consequences of this reorientation of our understanding of the relationship between speaker and that which is spoken, storyteller and story, and ultimately identity and truth have been profound and lasting. But also, in its more extreme formulations, pernicious. It was the overextension of his principal claim that set in motion and empowered a deconstructionist movement that would, in the decades to come, successfully elevate the importance of the identity of the speaker over that which is said.<a class="char-fnref footnote_ref" epub:type="noteref" href="Karp_9780593798706_epub3_c007_r1.xhtml#_footnote_d1-00015eaf" id="_footnote_referrer_d1-00015eaf" role="doc-noteref" title="footnote">[*3]</a></p>
			<p class="para-p">The critics were many, and came from every angle. For one, Said seemed less interested in documenting the similar systems of “power-knowledge” that had been developed in the East to justify the subjugation of various underclasses within the subaltern world itself. <span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText242"/>As Mishra has observed, “The book displayed no awareness of the vast <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_93" role="doc-pagebreak" title="93"/>archive of Asian, African, and Latin-American thought that had preceded it, including discourses devised by non-Western élites—such as the Brahminical theory of caste in India—to make their dominance seem natural and legitimate.”</p>
			<p class="para-p">Others attempted to hit more directly at what they perceived to be Said’s central argument. William McNeill of the University of Chicago, for example, who was a defender of the Western civilization course requirements that were gradually and then more swiftly eliminated in the 1960s, had the temerity to resist the rise of what he would describe as the moral relativism that was ascendant in the second half of the twentieth century and that he and other critics claimed would often cloak itself in the more palatable rubric of multiculturalism. <span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText243"/>McNeill wrote in an essay published in 1997 that attempts to construct world history courses had themselves “often been contaminated” by what he regarded “as patently false assertions of the equality of all cultural traditions.” He was not responding directly to Said, but Said and his arguments were so omnipresent at the time that anyone wading into such debates by that point was necessarily in conversation with him.</p>
			<p class="para-p">It is also a reminder of how swiftly the culture moves, given that a claim such as McNeill’s would almost certainly require cancellation today. The species of historian who dared to make normative claims about culture, including the specific merits or lack thereof with respect to particular cultures, was essentially rendered extinct, or at least jobless, by the end of the twentieth century. Even modest attempts to point to the differences in economic output and military power between Europe and its former empires over the past five centuries or so have been pushed to the fringe of the cultural conversation. <span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText244"/>As the historian Niall Ferguson has observed, the principal Western empires that began their ascent in the sixteenth century came to control 74 percent of global economic production by the 1910s.</p>

			<p class="para-p">The mere recitation of such a fact has become provocative in a way that suggests our current culture’s fundamental unease with truth, as well as perhaps its loss of an ability to disentangle descriptive claims from normative ones. To point out, as an empirical matter, that a certain subset of nations has come to dominate global affairs is not equivalent to the normative claim that such a result is justified. In the West, however, many observers have lost interest in investigating the causes and reasons for this outperformance. We have been taught simply to turn away, to change the subject. <span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText245"/>The ability to reckon with a descriptive claim acknowledging the overwhelming dominance of the United States and its allies while suspending discussion, even momentarily, of the moral implications of that distribution of power is arguably a form of what the journalist <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_95" role="doc-pagebreak" title="95"/>and opinion researcher Nate Silver has called “decoupling.” This capacity for evaluating the truth of a statement while setting aside one’s views about either its implications or one’s opinion “on the identity of the speaker,” as Silver puts it, has withered among far too many. One should be able to decide whether a descriptive claim is true without knowing anything about who is making it.</p>
			<p class="para-p">A respect for one’s intellectual adversary, even if begrudging, can be an enormous advantage, particularly in a culture that has grown accustomed to belittling its opponents instead of engaging with them. In the realm of politics, and certainly business, far too many participants are incapable of maintaining a sense of emotional distance from their adversaries, of approaching them with the clarity and almost magnanimity that the best competitors bring to the arena. The most effective minds are often the ones who understand deeply the advantages and skills of their antagonists and refuse to fight religious wars of outrage and moral indignation. A fog of self-righteousness is often lethal to good judgment. As Vannevar Bush observed, writing in 1949, the failure of the Nazis to develop a sufficiently effective proximity fuse, which allowed bombs to detonate just prior to hitting their targets, was a consequence of their arrogance, not their incompetence. <span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText246"/>The Germans, he wrote, were incredulous that “the <i class="char-i">verdammter Amerikaner</i>” had succeeded “where they had failed.”</p>
			<hr class="transition"/>

			<p class="para-paft">The systematic challenge to the West in the second half of the twentieth century, its history and identity, along with that of the American project, what it was or should be, if anything, has left a void in its wake. A regime of knowledge had perhaps rightly been torn down. But nothing has been erected in its place. The canon wars as they would come to be known on university campuses in the 1960s and later, as well as the challenge in academia to the West itself that <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_96" role="doc-pagebreak" title="96"/>would follow, represented a struggle not merely over the content of American identity but over whether there should be any content at all.</p>
			<p class="para-p">The thin conception of belonging to the American community consisted of a respect for the rights of others and a broad commitment to neoliberal economic policies of free trade and the power of the market. The thicker conception of belonging required a story of what the American project has been, is, and will be—what it means to participate in this wild and rich experiment in building a republic. In this country and many others, membership in the community of the nation is at risk of being reduced to something narrow and incomplete, the loose sense of affiliation that comes from sharing a language or popular culture, for example, from entertainment to sports to fashion. And many have advocated for this retreat. By the end of the 1970s, an entire generation had grown skeptical of broader national identity or shared endeavors. And that generation, including many who would go on to found Silicon Valley and spur the computing revolution, turned its attention elsewhere, to the individual consumer, disinterested in furthering the misadventures of a government whose entire project and reason for being had so thoroughly been called into question.</p>
