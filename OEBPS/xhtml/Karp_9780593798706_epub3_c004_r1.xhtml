			<p class="para-pf dropcaps2line char-dropcap-DC" style="text-indent:0;">O<span class="char-first"><span class="fv-allsmallcaps">n July 16, 1945, </span></span>in the darkness before dawn, a group of scientists and government officials were gathered at a desolate stretch of sand in the New Mexico desert to witness humanity’s first test of a nuclear weapon. It had been raining the night before, and there was uncertainty as to whether the test could proceed. <span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText94"/>The rain, however, stopped early that morning. J. Robert Oppenheimer was there, as well as Vannevar Bush. <span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText95"/>The explosion was described by an observer as “brilliant purple,” and the thunder from the bomb’s detonation seemed to ricochet and linger in the desert. On that morning in New Mexico, Oppenheimer contemplated the possibility that this next era of destructive power might somehow contribute to an enduring peace. <span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText96"/>A government report by the U.S. Department of Energy written decades later noted that Oppenheimer recalled that morning the hope of Alfred Nobel, the Swedish industrialist and philanthropist, that dynamite, which Nobel had invented, “would end wars.”</p>
			<p class="para-p"><span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText97"/>Nobel, who was born in Stockholm in 1833, had made his fortune in the late nineteenth century experimenting with a new and explosive form of nitroglycerin, selling it to miners across Europe, including in Germany and Belgium, and explorers heading west across the Rocky Mountains in the United States in search of gold. <span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText98"/>The industrial chemical, however, had quickly been adapted for use by military engineers to make bombs. <span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText99"/>In the early 1870s, for example, dynamite <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_38" role="doc-pagebreak" title="38"/>was used extensively in the war between France and Prussia that left Alsace-Lorraine in the hands of Germany, according to Edith Patterson Meyer, a biographer of Nobel. <span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText100"/>At first, Nobel intended that his invention be used only for “peaceful purposes,” Meyer recounted. His thinking, however, grew increasingly pragmatic over the years, as the idealism and desire for intellectual purity that had characterized his earliest aspirations for his invention seemed to fade. In 1891, while living in Paris, Nobel confided in a letter to a friend that more capable weapons, not less, would be the best guarantors of peace. “<span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText101"/>The only thing that will ever prevent nations from beginning war is terror,” he wrote.</p>
			<p class="para-p">Our temptation may be to recoil from this sort of grim calculus, to retreat into a hope that an essentially peaceable instinct of our species would prevail if only those with the weapons took the risk of laying them down. It has been nearly eighty years since that first test of an atomic bomb in New Mexico, however, and nuclear weapons have been used in war only twice, at Hiroshima and Nagasaki in Japan. The power and horror wrought by the bomb have grown distant and faint, almost abstract, for many. <span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText102"/>John Hersey, the American journalist who traveled to Japan in the wake of the attacks, noted that the bomb used on Hiroshima ended the lives of nearly 100,000 people in a single moment, sending thousands more to the city’s main hospital, which had only six hundred beds. <span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText103"/>The destruction was total and complete. Hersey wrote that the flash of fire had left patterns in the shape of flowers on the bodies of some women—with the black-and-white cloth of their kimonos reflecting the heat of the blast.</p>
			<p class="para-p">The use of atomic weapons in Japan was only the final act of an equally brutal and unrelenting assault against the country’s civilian population. American warplanes, including four-engine B-29 bombers made by Boeing, had pounded cities from Tokyo to Nagoya for months with firebombs. <span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText104"/>Their purpose was to level buildings and kill civilians in the hope of forcing the Japanese military to surrender <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_39" role="doc-pagebreak" title="39"/>after its march across the Pacific—a march that resulted in the deaths of millions. It was a dark logic, and debates as to the necessity of the indiscriminate carpet bombings, of both Japan and Germany, let alone the use of nuclear weapons, rightly continue to this day. “<span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText105"/>We hated what we were doing,” a U.S. airman who flew in one of the B-29 bombers over Tokyo in March 1945 later recalled in an interview. “But we thought we had to do it. We thought that raid might cause the Japanese to surrender.”<a class="char-fnref footnote_ref" epub:type="noteref" href="Karp_9780593798706_epub3_c004_r1.xhtml#_footnote_d1-00015e85" id="_footnote_referrer_d1-00015e85" role="doc-noteref" title="footnote">[*1]</a></p>
			<p class="para-p">The American strategy was the outgrowth of a new type of war, one that did not distinguish between combatants on the battlefield and civilians working in factories and the fields. In 1935, Erich Ludendorff, a general in the German army during World War I who would later challenge Paul von Hindenburg for the country’s presidency, had written of “the total war,” or <i class="char-i">der totale Krieg</i>, as Adolf Hitler cemented control of Germany’s national government. Ludendorff was a revered figure among the German elite. <span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText106"/>In a dispatch from Berlin for the <i class="char-i">Atlantic</i> in 1917, H. L. Mencken wrote that some members of the German military described the general as “the serpent, the genius,” and noted that he was adept at “keeping his finger in a multitude of remote and microscopic pies.” <span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText107"/>For Ludendorff, under the logic of this new form of military conflict, “the peoples themselves” were rightly “subject to the direct operations of war,” and as a result were considered legitimate targets of attack.</p>
			<p class="para-p">In the eighty years since the bombings of Japan, however, a nuclear weapon has never once been used again in war. <span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText108"/>The record of humanity’s management of the weapon conjured by Oppenheimer and others—imperfect and indeed, dozens of times, nearly catastrophic—has been remarkable and often overlooked. Too many have forgotten or perhaps take for granted that nearly a century of some <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_40" role="doc-pagebreak" title="40"/>version of peace has prevailed in the world without a great power military conflict. At least three generations—billions of people and their children and now grandchildren—have never known a world war. The atomic age and the Cold War essentially cemented a relationship among the great powers that made true escalation, not skirmishes and tests of strength at the margins of regional conflicts, exceedingly unattractive and potentially costly. John Lewis Gaddis, a military and naval history professor at Yale, has described the lack of major conflict in the postwar era as the “long peace.” <span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText109"/>Nearly forty years ago, in 1987, Gaddis noted that the length and durability of the relative peace that had prevailed for decades after the end of World War II was “the longest period of stability in relations among the great powers that the world has known in this century,” even rivaling comparable periods of relative calm “in all of modern history.” The record now of an even longer peace, approaching a century, is only more remarkable today. <span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText110"/>Steven Pinker, in his book <i class="char-i">The Better Angels of Our Nature</i>, published in 2011, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_41" role="doc-pagebreak" title="41"/>argued that the recent lack of broad conflict and “decline of violence may be the most significant and least appreciated development in the history of our species.”</p>

			<p class="para-p">It would be unreasonable to assign all or even most of the credit for bringing about such a durable period of relative tranquility in world history to a single weapon. <span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText111"/>Any number of other developments since the end of World War II, including the proliferation of democratic forms of government across the planet and a level of interconnected economic activity that would have once been unthinkable, are certainly part of the story. And the delicate balance of power that for the most part has encouraged a reluctance to court the possibility of direct clashes could also change quickly. Yet the supremacy of American military power over the past century has undoubtedly helped guard the current, albeit fragile, peace. A commitment to the maintenance of such supremacy, however, has become increasingly unfashionable in the West. And deterrence, as a doctrine, is at risk of losing its moral appeal.</p>

			<p class="para-paft">It was for a time considered unnecessarily provocative and nearly impolite to suggest that Europe was not spending a sufficient amount on its own defense—that the continent was essentially benefiting from an enormous investment in national security by the United States, some $900 billion per year, without sharing in its costs. For decades, America has been spending approximately 3 to 5 percent of its GDP on defense, while military expenditures by the European Union have hovered at around 1.5 percent over that same period.</p>
			<p class="para-p">More pointed critiques of the European approach, with its massive reliance on the United States, have grown increasingly frequent in recent years. In April 2016, President Barack Obama expressed frustration with Europe’s anemic defense spending in an interview <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_42" role="doc-pagebreak" title="42"/>with Jeffrey Goldberg of the <i class="char-i">Atlantic</i>. “<span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText112"/>Free riders aggravate me,” Obama said. At the time, the United Kingdom, like nearly all of its European neighbors, had been spending less than two percent of its GDP on defense—a threshold that Obama told David Cameron, the British prime minister, that the country would have to meet if it wanted to maintain its vaunted “special relationship” with the United States, according to Goldberg. “You have to pay your fair share,” Obama warned Cameron.</p>

			<p class="para-p">Josep Borrell, the EU high representative for foreign affairs and security policy, has noted a broader and more structural retreat from investment in national defense by Europe since the early 1990s. “<span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText113"/>After the Cold War, we shrunk our forces to bonsai armies,” Borrell has said. <span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText114"/>The implications of the fractured European approach to defense spending and acquisition are significant, with the procurement machines of nearly thirty nations pursuing different strategies with different suppliers across the continent and the world. “<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_43" role="doc-pagebreak" title="43"/>Europe’s bonsai armies have nurtured bonsai industries,” Christian Mölling of the German Council on Foreign Relations told the <i class="char-i">Economist</i> in a 2024 interview.</p>
			<p class="para-p">For those who founded the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) in 1949, the linchpin of the Western alliance, Europe’s disinterest in developing a robust means of self-defense, nearly eighty years after the end of World War II, would be considered a remarkable failure. <span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText115"/>In February 1951, President Dwight D. Eisenhower wrote a letter to his friend Edward J. Bermingham, who led the Chicago business of Lehman Brothers, expressing a hope that Europe would quickly develop its own capacity to defend its interests by force, if necessary. <span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText116"/>The challenge, as Eisenhower put it, was “how to inspire Europe to produce for itself those armed forces that, in the long run, must provide the only means by which Europe can be defended.” He added that the United States “cannot be a modern Rome guarding the far frontiers with our own legions.”</p>
			<p class="para-p">A resistance to further military investment has, of course, been particularly pervasive in Germany. Günter Grass, the novelist and author of <i class="char-i">The Tin Drum</i>, famously opposed the reunification of East and West Germany on the grounds that a united nation would raise the possibility of another Auschwitz. <span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText117"/>In 1991 he wrote, “Nothing, no sense of nationhood, however idyllically colored, and no assurance of late-born benevolence can modify or dispel the experience that we the criminals, with our victims, had as a unified Germany.” The neutering, however, of the country over the past half century has had consequences. The retreat of a muscular and assertive Germany undoubtedly contributed to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Vladimir Putin calculated correctly that he would not pay a significant price for it. After decades of self-flagellation, Germany’s military had retreated into something of a caricature of an actual armed force.</p>
			<p class="para-p">The same could very well be said of Japan. The region’s wealthiest democracy would still today require the assistance of the United <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_44" role="doc-pagebreak" title="44"/>States in order to repel let alone survive a real invasion. In 1947, following the surrender of Japanese forces to the Allies, the country adopted a blanket prohibition on the maintenance of a military for offensive purposes. <span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText118"/>Article 9 of the nation’s constitution states that “the Japanese people forever renounce war as a sovereign right of the nation and the threat or use of force as means of settling international disputes,” and, as a result, “land, sea, and air forces, as well as other war potential, will never be maintained.” The provision, which is still technically the law of the land today, in effect requires that other nations, including the United States, defend the country if it were ever attacked.</p>
			<p class="para-p">The mistake was not to dismantle Japan’s imperial army and enact legal safeguards to prevent its resurrection in the immediate aftermath of the war. It was to maintain the same policy for three-quarters of a century, through the remaking of world order, including the rise of an assertive and capable China as well as a newly ambitious Russia. The defanging of Germany was an overcorrection for which Europe is now paying a heavy price. A similar and highly theatrical commitment to Japanese pacifism will, if maintained, also threaten to shift the balance of power in Asia. The virtue of the advent of new technologies, including artificial intelligence for the battlefield, is that they provide nations with an opportunity to pivot, and rapidly, but only if their leaders can marshal the public will to be prepared to fight.</p>

			<p class="para-paft">The F-35 fighter jet was conceived of in the mid-1990s, and the airplane—the flagship attack aircraft of American and allied forces built by Lockheed Martin—is scheduled to be in service for another sixty-three years. <span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText119"/>The total cost of the program is currently estimated to be $2 trillion, according to the U.S. government. <span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText120"/>But as General Mark Milley, former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said in <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_45" role="doc-pagebreak" title="45"/>2024 at a national security conference in Washington, D.C., “Do we really think a manned aircraft is going to be winning the skies in 2088?”</p>
			<p class="para-p">The atomic age is coming to a close. This is the software century, and the decisive wars of the future will be driven by artificial intelligence, whose development is proceeding on a far different, and faster, timeline than weapons of the past. A fundamental reversal in the relationship between hardware and software is taking place. For the twentieth century, software had been built to maintain and service the needs of hardware, from flight controls to missile avionics, and fueling systems to armored personnel carriers. With the rise of AI and the use of large language models on the battlefield to metabolize data and make targeting recommendations, however, the relationship is shifting. Software is now at the helm, with hardware—the drones on the battlefields of Europe and elsewhere—increasingly serving as the means by which the recommendations of AI are implemented in the world. <span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText121"/>The arrival of swarms of drones capable of targeting and killing an adversary, all at a fraction of the cost of conventional weapons, is nearly here. Yet the level of investment in such technologies, and the software systems that will be required for them to operate, are far from sufficient. The U.S. government is still focused on developing a legacy infrastructure—the planes, ships, tanks, and missiles—that delivered dominance on the battlefield in the last century but will almost certainly not be as central in this one.</p>
			<p class="para-p"><span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText122"/>The U.S. Department of Defense requested a total of $1.8 billion to fund artificial intelligence capabilities in 2024, representing only 0.2 percent—a fifth of 1 percent—of the country’s total proposed national defense budget of $886 billion. And for nations that hold themselves to a far higher moral standard than their adversaries when it comes to the use of force, even technical parity with an enemy is insufficient. A weapons system in the hands of an ethical society, and one rightly wary of its use, will act as an effective deterrent only if it <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_46" role="doc-pagebreak" title="46"/>is far more powerful than the capability of an adversary who would not hesitate to kill the innocent.</p>
			<p class="para-p">The United States and its allies abroad should without delay commit to launching a new Manhattan Project in order to retain exclusive control over the most sophisticated forms of AI for the battlefield—the targeting systems and swarms of drones and eventually robots that will become the most powerful weapons of this century. The aircraft carriers and fighter jets that defined warfare in the last era will become accessories to software—the means by which increasingly intelligent systems wield power in the world. Our defense budget, and the legions of personnel charged with overseeing it, are out of date by decades. An urgent effort to shift the emphasis of our investment in national security, bringing together America and its partners in Europe and Asia, must be launched now.</p>
			<p class="para-p">The challenge is that the ascendant engineering elite in Silicon Valley that is most capable of building the artificial intelligence systems that will be the deterrent of this century is also most ambivalent about working for the U.S. military. An entire generation of software engineers, capable of building the next generation of AI weaponry, has turned its back on the nation-state, disinterested in the messiness and moral complexity of geopolitics. While pockets of support for defense work have emerged in recent years, the vast majority of money and talent continues to stream toward the consumer. The technological class instinctively rushes to raise capital for video-sharing apps and social media platforms, advertising algorithms and online shopping websites. They do not hesitate to track and monetize our every movement online, burrowing their way into our lives. Yet these same engineers, and the Silicon Valley giants they have built, often balk when it comes to working with the U.S. military. The irony, of course, is that the peace and freedom that those in Silicon Valley who are opposed to working with the U.S. military enjoy are made possible by that same military’s credible threat of force.</p>
			<p class="para-p"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_47" role="doc-pagebreak" title="47"/>The risk is that a generation’s disenchantment with the nation-state and disinterest in our collective defense have resulted in an unquestioned yet massive redirection of resources, both intellectual and financial, to sating the often capricious needs of capitalism’s consumer culture. Our loss of cultural ambition, and the diminishing demands we place on the technology sector to produce products of enduring and collective value to the public, have ceded too much control to the whims of the market. <span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText123"/>As David Graeber, who taught cultural anthropology at Yale and the London School of Economics, observed in an essay published in 2012 in the <i class="char-i">Baffler</i>, “The Internet is a remarkable innovation, but all we are talking about is a super-fast and globally accessible combination of library, post office, and mail-order catalogue.” He, and many others, have been left wanting more.</p>
			<p class="para-p">In November 2022, when OpenAI, which has invested billions of dollars into the development of large language models such as ChatGPT, first released its AI interface to the public, the company’s policies prohibited the use of its technologies for “military and warfare” purposes, a broad concession to those wary of any entanglements with the soldiers sent into harm’s way to defend the nation. <span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText124"/>After the company changed course in early 2024 and removed the blanket prohibition on military applications, protesters promptly gathered in San Francisco outside the office of Sam Altman, the chief executive officer, with organizers of the protest demanding that OpenAI “end its relationship with the Pentagon and not take any military clients.” The engineers building the language models that drive ChatGPT, a spectacular advance in the way computing intelligence approaches problems, are more than content to lend the power of their creation to corporations selling consumer goods yet hesitate when asked to provide more effective software to the U.S. Army and Navy.</p>
			<p class="para-p">The threat of such protest and outrage from the crowd is that it shapes and influences the instincts of leaders and investors across the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_48" role="doc-pagebreak" title="48"/>technology industry, many of whom have been trained to systematically avoid any hint of controversy or disapproval. And the costs of such avoidance—as well as the industry’s near-complete capitulation to the whims of the market for direction as to what <i class="char-i">ought</i> to be built, not merely what <i class="char-i">can</i> be built—are significant.</p>
			<p class="para-p"><span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText125"/>In an essay titled “Big Idea Famine,” published in the <i class="char-i">Journal of Design and Science</i> in 2018, Nicholas Negroponte, co-founder of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s Media Lab, noted the legions of “start-ups today that focus on thoughtless ways to do our laundry, deliver food or entertain ourselves with another app.” The challenge, he added, is that “new technologies, real discoveries, and inventions in science and engineering are often trivialized by the start-up process in order to meet the expectations of investors.” Many entrepreneurs and armies of extraordinarily talented engineers simply set the hard problems aside. This retreat of ambition has coincided with what the economist Robert J. Gordon has argued has been a significant decline in our rate of productivity as a society in <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_49" role="doc-pagebreak" title="49"/>the United States over the past three-quarters of a century. <span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText126"/>As Gordon has written, in the decades since 1970, technological developments “have mostly occurred in a narrow sphere of activity having to do with entertainment, communications and the collection and processing of information,” whereas “for the rest of what humans care about—food, clothing, shelter, transportation, health and working conditions both inside and outside the home—progress has slowed.”</p>

			<p class="para-p">There are exceptions to the technology industry’s broad retreat of ambition. Elon Musk, for example, has founded two companies, Tesla and SpaceX, among others, that have stepped forward to fill glaring innovation gaps where national governments have stepped back. The challenges of developing a reliable alternative to the internal combustion engine, and to sending rockets into outer space, in another era would have been the comfortable and logical preserve of government. The resources required to confront such challenges are enormous. Yet far too few have been willing to risk their capital or reputations in attempting to address them. The culture almost snickers at Musk’s interest in grand narrative, as if billionaires ought to simply stay in their lane of enriching themselves and perhaps providing occasional fodder for celebrity gossip columns. <span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText127"/>A profile of Musk in the <i class="char-i">New Yorker</i> published in 2023 suggested that the world would be better off with fewer “mega-rich luxury planet builders,” decrying his “seeming estrangement from humanity itself.”<a class="char-fnref footnote_ref" epub:type="noteref" href="Karp_9780593798706_epub3_c004_r1.xhtml#_footnote_d1-00015e8c" id="_footnote_referrer_d1-00015e8c" role="doc-noteref" title="footnote">[*2]</a> <span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText129"/>For years, many were convinced that SpaceX’s reusable rockets were “a fool’s errand” and that Musk was “flat-out wasting his time,” according to a 2015 biography of the founder. Any curiosity or genuine interest in the value of what he has created is essentially dismissed, or perhaps lurks from beneath a thinly veiled scorn. The irony is that many of those who profess most strenuously that they oppose the excesses of capitalism are often the first in line to skewer those who <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_50" role="doc-pagebreak" title="50"/>have the audacity to attempt building something that the market has failed to provide. More ambition and seriousness of purpose, not less, are needed. Is the iPhone, for example, our greatest creative if not crowning achievement as a civilization? The object has changed our lives, but it may also now be limiting and constraining our sense of the possible. <span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText130"/>As Peter Thiel observed in an interview in 2011, the radical and discontinuous leap forward of the Apollo space program, not the incremental advances in the capabilities of consumer gadgets, should be the bar by which we judge ourselves and assess human progress.</p>
			<p class="para-p">A generation of ascendant founders says it actively seeks out risk, but when it comes to public relations and deeper investments in more significant societal challenges, caution often prevails. Why take the chance of entering into the moral morass of geopolitics and courting controversy when you can build another app?</p>
			<p class="para-p">And build apps they did. The proliferation of social media empires across the United States, which systematically monetize and channel the human desire for status and recognition, preying on and programming the young to find rewards in the often fickle affection and approval of their peers, has redirected far too great a share of the efforts and resources of an entire civilization. <span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText131"/>In 2022, YouTube made $959 million from advertising that was targeted at 31.4 million children under the age of twelve. Instagram made $801 million in a year from that same age-group. We must rise up and rage against this misdirection of our culture and capital. <span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText132"/>Let us not go gentle into that good night.<a class="char-fnref footnote_ref" epub:type="noteref" href="Karp_9780593798706_epub3_c004_r1.xhtml#_footnote_d1-00015e8f" id="_footnote_referrer_d1-00015e8f" role="doc-noteref" title="footnote">[*3]</a></p>

			<p class="para-paft">Our adversaries will proceed with the development of artificial intelligence for the battlefield whether or not we do. The leaders of authoritarian regimes might very well lose their lives if they lose control. Xi Jinping, China’s head of state, was born in 1953, four years after the end of the country’s communist revolution. At the age of fifteen, he was sent to Liangjiahe, a village to the northeast of Xian in Shaanxi province, where he lived in a cave and was forced to work in the fields, according to an account of his youth. “<span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText133"/>He ate bitterness like the rest of us,” a farmer who knew Xi during those early years told a newspaper in 2012. It was a period of immense social upheaval. <span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText134"/>Xi’s older sister, Heping, might have killed herself in the hands of the Red Guards, the students and others that Mao Zedong at first rallied in support of his revolution and then scrambled to contain in the 1960s. <span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText135"/>An official government account reveals little, noting only that Heping was “persecuted to death.” <span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText136"/>As a professor of international relations explained in an interview with Evan Osnos of the <i class="char-i">New Yorker</i> in 2022, many of Xi’s contemporaries who lived through the Cultural Revolution “concluded that China needed constitutionalism and rule of law, but Xi Jinping said no: You need the Leviathan.” The cultivation of hard power, including AI for the battlefield, is a necessity to survive. Xi understands this in a way that those in the West, the self-proclaimed victors of history, often forget.</p>
			<p class="para-p">The American foreign policy establishment has repeatedly miscalculated when dealing with China, Russia, and others, believing that the promise of economic integration alone will be sufficient to undercut their leadership’s support at home and diminish their interest in military escalations abroad. The failure of the Davos consensus, the reigning approach to international relations, was to abandon the stick in favor of the carrot alone. <span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText137"/>Anne Applebaum rightly reminds us that a “natural liberal world order” does not exist, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_52" role="doc-pagebreak" title="52"/>despite our most fervent aspirations, and that “there are no rules without someone to enforce them.” Xi and others have wielded and retained power in a way that most of our current political leaders in the West will never understand. Our mistake is to hope that authoritarian regimes, with enough proximity to and encouragement from our own, will realize the error of their ways. <span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText138"/>But as Henry Kissinger has observed, “The institutions of the West did not spring full-blown from the brow of contemporaries but evolved over centuries.”</p>
			<p class="para-p">We must not lose interest in investigating the psychology and worldview of our adversaries, in inhabiting the constraints within which they operate, the risks they face to maintaining control, their personal ambitions, and aspirations for their people. Xi and his family have demonstrated a curiosity and interest in the United States for decades. <span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText139"/>In 1985, he spent time in Muscatine, Iowa, as part of a delegation from China to the United States, staying in a local family’s home. <span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText140"/>And Xi’s only daughter, Xi Mingze, graduated from Harvard in May 2014, using a pseudonym and studying English and psychology. <span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText141"/>A reporter for a Japanese newspaper said that fewer than ten people were aware of Mingze’s real identity while she was at school.</p>
			<p class="para-p">On a visit to the United States in 2015, Xi gave a speech in Seattle in which he recalled reading Henry David Thoreau, Walt Whitman, and Mark Twain when he was young. Ernest Hemingway left a particular impression on him, and Xi remembered <i class="char-i">The</i> <i class="char-i">Old Man and the Sea</i> with affection. When Xi visited Cuba, he told the audience that he made a trip to Cojímar, a district outside central Havana on the country’s northern coast, which had provided inspiration for Hemingway’s story of a fisherman and his eighteen-foot marlin. <span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText142"/>On a later trip, Xi mentioned that he “ordered a mojito,” the author’s favorite, “with mint leaves and ice.” Xi explained that he “just wanted to feel for myself” what Hemingway had been thinking and the place he had been when “he wrote those stories.” The leader of a nation with nearly one-fifth of the world’s population added that it <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_53" role="doc-pagebreak" title="53"/>was “important to make an effort to get a deep understanding of the cultures and civilizations that are different from our own.” We would be well advised to do the same.</p>

			<p class="para-paft">The reluctance on the part of the United States and its allies to proceed with the development of more effective and autonomous weapons systems for military use may stem from a justified skepticism of power itself and coercion—a distaste for further investment in the machinery of war by the victors of history. The appeal of pacifism is that it satisfies our instinctive empathy for the powerless. <span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText143"/>But as Chloé Morin, a French author and former adviser to the country’s prime minister, suggested in a recent interview, we might resist the facile urge “to divide the world into dominants and dominated, oppressors and the oppressed.” <span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText144"/>This “moral dualism,” in the words of Remi Adekoya, a professor at the University of York in the United Kingdom, leaves many uncomfortable, condemning harm against those who in certain domains occupy positions of power. It would be a mistake, however, and indeed a form of moral condescension, to systematically equate powerlessness with piousness. The subjugated and the subjugators are both equally capable of grievous sin. <span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText145"/>Yet we still cling to dangerous and pervasive mythologies of a “pacified past,” as Lawrence H. Keeley described it in <i class="char-i">War Before Civilization</i>, published in 1996, in which he recounted the history of often brutal violence in preindustrial societies, from the Cheyenne in the Great Plains of North America to the Dani in New Guinea. Keeley, for instance, noted that some indigenous tribes on the American Plains “mutilated their foes’ corpses in characteristic ways as a kind of ‘signature’: the Sioux by cutting throats, the Cheyenne by slashing arms, the Arapaho by splitting noses.” The Dani in Indonesia, for their part, used mud or grease on their arrowheads to increase the chances of infection for those they shot.</p>
			<p class="para-p"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_54" role="doc-pagebreak" title="54"/>The roots of this moral logic run deep and may be difficult to dislodge. In 1968, Paulo Freire, the Brazilian writer, published <i class="char-i">Pedagogy of the Oppressed</i>, in which he articulated a logic of oppressor and oppressed that continues to structure our intellectual and moral discourse half a century later. One of his central claims was that the oppressed peoples of the world, the underclass, were essentially incapable themselves of violence, or indeed oppression itself. He neutered the dispossessed of moral agency. “<span id="Y_d1-EndnotePhraseInText146"/>Never in history has violence been initiated by the oppressed,” he wrote. “It is not the helpless, subject to terror, who initiate terror, but the violent.” For him, the subjugated peoples of the world were essentially incapable themselves of victimizing others, only of being victims. But this reductionist insistence on imposing such a totalizing and complete identity on the purportedly powerless may have the unintended consequence of depriving them of moral agency and indeed their humanity as well.</p>
			<p class="para-p">The allure of pacifism, and a potential retreat from deterrence, is that it relieves us of the need to navigate among the difficult and imperfect trade-offs that the world presents. The broader question we face is not whether a new generation of increasingly autonomous weapons incorporating artificial intelligence will be built. It is who will build them and for what purpose. This is the software century, and yet our challenge is that the generation that is most capable and best positioned to construct this next wave of offensive capabilities is also the most content to retreat from projects involving national defense or communal purpose. It is this hollowing out of the American mind—and not only in Silicon Valley, as we will see in the next chapter—that has led us to the current impasse. And it is that hollowing out of the American project that has left us vulnerable and exposed.</p>
